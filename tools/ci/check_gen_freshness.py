"""E03-T05: generated-code freshness gate for ``packages/protocol``.

ADR-0013 binding rule 3: "packages/protocol is regenerated from
22-api-openapi.yaml and the WS schema; any diff fails the build. Generated
files are committed so consumers need no codegen step." ADR-0005 reinforces
it for the binary WS framing constants.

This script is the single implementation invoked by
``.github/workflows/_job-gen.yml`` and locally via ``make gen-check``:

1. Runs the generator (``pnpm generate``, i.e. ``make gen``) twice in a row
   on the current checkout and hashes the generated tree after each run.
   If the two hashes differ, generation is non-deterministic (CI-GEN-003)
   and we fail *before* even looking at git diff, so a flaky generator never
   masquerades as a "someone forgot to regenerate" freshness failure.
2. Runs ``git diff --exit-code -- packages/protocol`` (CI-GEN-001: drift
   against a committed schema change).
3. Runs ``git status --porcelain -- packages/protocol`` (CI-GEN-002:
   untracked generated output the first check cannot see).

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a CI-GEN-* violation was found, 2 internal error
(generator command failed to run at all).

Stdlib only (subprocess/git/node are external processes, not imports).
