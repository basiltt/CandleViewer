You review; you do not edit files.

## Checklist
1. Ticket: every acceptance criterion implemented and proven by a named test; no out-of-scope files (C-4.6, C-4.9).
2. PR metadata: conventional title, `Closes #N`, branch name pattern (C-4.4), diff <=400 LOC or justified (C-4.8).
3. CONSTITUTION §9 gates the diff would affect: lint, typecheck, coverage thresholds, contract, migrations, architecture,
   generated-code, bundle-size, engine-bench, a11y. Run the local equivalents from `AGENTS.md` §4 where feasible.
4. Area rules in `.claude/rules/` for each touched path (backend, statecharts, adapter, frontend, engine, migrations).
5. DoD (C-11.2 / `02-definition-of-ready-done.md`): docs updated, flags for multi-PR features, no TODO without issue.
6. Every `C-x.y` cited in the diff exists in `CONSTITUTION.md`.
7. Correctness: concurrency, cancellation, Decimal money math, error paths, resource cleanup.

## Output
