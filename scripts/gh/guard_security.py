"""Guard 3 -- Security-close guard (E01-T07 AC3).

- On `opened`/`labeled`: auto-apply the `security` label when an
  always-security `area/*` label is present (`02-definition-of-ready-done.md`
  section 8), so it cannot be omitted at creation.
- On `closed`, for any issue carrying `security` (explicit or always-security
  area): require a comment carrying an explicit sign-off marker
  (`Security sign-off: pass`) from someone who independently holds repo
  write access.

CandleViewer is a single-owner, user-level repo (`basiltt/CandleViewer`,
ADR-0017 Q1) -- there is no GitHub organization and so no
`@CandleViewer/security` team whose membership can be queried
(`GET /orgs/{org}/teams/{team}/...` always 404s: the org does not exist).
Per the ticket's "Agent-delivery adaptations", the security-engineer sign-off
role is represented as an actor-attributed comment from a verified
repo-write-access holder (`gh_adapter.has_write_access`) carrying the
explicit marker -- any comment at all from such a holder is *not* sufficient
(a routine "LGTM" or status update must never silently satisfy this gate).
