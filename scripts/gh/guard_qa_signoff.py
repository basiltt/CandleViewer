"""Guard 2 -- QA sign-off (E01-T07 AC1/AC2/AC4).

CandleViewer is a single-owner, user-level repo (`basiltt/CandleViewer`,
ADR-0017 Q1) -- there is no GitHub organization and so no `@CandleViewer/qa`
team whose membership can be queried (`GET /orgs/{org}/teams/{team}/...`
always 404s: the org does not exist). Per the ticket's "Agent-delivery
adaptations", role sign-offs are represented as an **actor-attributed
comment from someone who independently holds repo write access** (verified
via `gh_adapter.has_write_access`, a real, always-available collaborator-
permission check -- no PAT/App/org required) carrying the documented marker
(`QA sign-off: pass`), OR an explicitly recorded QA-capacity-deviation
statement by the ticket owner (permitted by
`docs/plan/02-definition-of-ready-done.md` section 3.2 / section 8).

A forged marker typed into the *issue body* by the author never satisfies
this guard -- only an actor-attributed *comment* from someone with verified
write access, or the owner's own deviation comment, counts. Being the
ticket's *author* is not itself a credential (anyone can open an issue and
comment as its author), so `issue.owner_login` alone can never be trusted to
grant a QA-skip -- both the sign-off and the deviation path require the
`author_has_write_access` check.
