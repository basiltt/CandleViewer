"""Shared rendered-body parsing module for GitHub issue-forms bodies (E01-T07).

Implements the rendered-body contract established by E01-T05's issue forms and
locked down by ``scripts/tests/test_issue_form_contract.py``:

- Each answerable field renders as a ``### <Label>`` heading followed by its
  answer (or the literal ``_No response_`` placeholder when an optional field
  was left blank).
- A heading that is entirely absent from the body (not rendered at all, e.g. an
  older issue predating a form change) is distinguishable from a heading that is
  present but empty.
- The ``N/A`` literal is treated case-sensitively -- callers must not normalise
  case when comparing against it.

This module has **no GitHub API dependency** so it is fully unit-testable
offline; the thin GitHub-side adapter (comments, labels, reopen) lives in the
guard modules that call it.
