/**
 * Route manifest (E10-T01). One entry per route ID in
 * `docs/plan/12-sitemap.md` §2 (R-001..R-903). Consumed by:
 *  - `tree.tsx` to build the React Router data router.
 *  - the command palette (E10-S03).
 *  - the E10-Q01 route-matrix test, which iterates every sitemap route ID
 *    and fails if this manifest is missing one.
 *
 * `owner` on a stub entry names the epic that will replace the placeholder
 * element; it has no runtime effect.
