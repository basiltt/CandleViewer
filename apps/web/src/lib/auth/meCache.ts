/**
 * Module-scoped `/me` claims cache (E10-T01 / E10-T04 contract).
 *
 * E10-T04 owns the real bootstrap fetch + background refresh; this ticket
 * only needs a minimal, synchronously-readable cache so route guards never
 * issue their own network request per navigation (`12-sitemap.md` §4,
 * "Performance notes" in the ticket body). The shape here is intentionally
 * small and is expected to be replaced/extended by E10-T04 without route
 * code changing.
