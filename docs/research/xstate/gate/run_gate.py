"""Run every check, probe and benchmark against an installed library version and
print a single pass/fail table.

Usage
-----
    <venv>/Scripts/python gate/run_gate.py                 # primary + secondary + probes
    <venv>/Scripts/python gate/run_gate.py --no-secondary  # primary + probes only
    <venv>/Scripts/python gate/run_gate.py --with-bench    # + benchmarks (slow)
    <venv>/Scripts/python gate/run_gate.py --only LC-01,LC-03
    <venv>/Scripts/python gate/run_gate.py --json out.json

Exit code
---------
    0  -- every BLOCKING check PASSED (primary set + probes + benches).
    1  -- at least one blocking check FAILED, or any check ERRORed.
    2  -- harness error (library not importable, paths missing, ...).

The two check sets -- read this before interpreting the table
-------------------------------------------------------------
From 0.8.0 the library fixes defects as **per-machine policies or additive APIs
whose default preserves the previous semantics**. One check set is therefore not
enough, and the exit code of a single script is not a verdict.

* **`verify` rows -- PRIMARY, BLOCKING.** `issues/verify-0.8.0/LC-xx_*.py`.
  These construct machines with the CandleViewer **mandated configuration**
  (`actionErrorPolicy`, `onUnhandled`, `guardErrorPolicy`, `strictTargets`,
  `strict`, a bounded inbox, an injected clock -- see
  `17-reeval-0.8.0-verdict.md` s.4) and answer the gate's real question: *with the
  configuration we are required to ship, is the defect gone?* A FAIL here is a
  genuine failure.

* **`verifyM` rows -- PRIMARY, BLOCKING.** `issues/verify-main-5327ba6/*.py`.
  The same contract, added by the `main` @ `5327ba6` verification pass
  (`22-verify-main-verdict.md`). These cover the issues re-verified in that
  window -- the `[Unreleased]`/0.8.1 fix wave (#27, #31, #37, #39/#75, #43,
  #44, #50/#76, #51, #52, #77, #78, #79, #80) -- and are kept as a separate,
  named set so a per-set regression is visible without diffing totals. Two
  scripts share the `LC-37` prefix; both run, disambiguated by file stem.

* **`verifyM2` rows -- PRIMARY, BLOCKING.** `issues/verify-main-3c527b0/*.py`.
  Added by the `main` @ `3c527b0` verification pass
  (`26-verify-3c527b0-verdict.md`), covering the three issues PR #83 closed
  (#43 one task per invoked child, #79 provenance-based system events, #80
  dedicated `ErrorEvent`). Same contract; kept as its own named, commit-keyed
  set per `20-adoption-gate.md` s.9.6 amendment 8, so a per-wave regression is
  visible without diffing totals. Baseline: 3/3 PASS -- ANY failure here is a
  regression.

* **`verifyM3` rows -- PRIMARY, BLOCKING.** `issues/verify-main-cec108b/*.py`.
  Added by the round-6 pass (`39-r6-final-readiness-verdict.md`), covering the
  26 issues verified on `main` @ `cec108b` -- the round-5 fix set #142-#162 plus
  the five narrow reopens #118/#122/#125/#133/#134. Same contract; own named,
  commit-keyed set. Baseline at cec108b: 24/26 PASS with exactly two expected
  FAILs (#122 PARTIAL -- documented rather than fixed; #157 NOT-FIXED as filed,
  reopened on narrower grounds). Any FAIL outside that pair is a regression.
  Round 7 (H-1) added `150` and `probe` to the expected set: both are pre-existing
  deterministic FAILs that appear in NO cec108b baseline JSON because the script
  directory gained those files after the allow-list was written. Confirmed 5/5
  deterministic and confirmed absent from `result-main-cec108b.json` by a direct
  check-by-check diff -- new rows, not PASS->FAIL transitions.

* **`verifyM4` rows -- PRIMARY, BLOCKING.** `issues/verify-main-221ce7c/*.py`.
  Added by the round-7 pass (`44-r7-final-readiness-verdict.md`), covering the
  12 issues verified on `main` @ `221ce7c` -- the round-6 fix set #166-#175 plus
  #157 and #122-as-designed. Own named, commit-keyed set. Baseline at 221ce7c:
  10/11 PASS with exactly one expected FAIL (#167 -- PARTIAL: bounded for plain
  `def` services, completely unbounded for `async def`; the coroutine half is
  R7-01). Any FAIL outside that is a regression.

  NOTE (round-7 standing amendment 12): a row that exercises an `invoke` and is
  NOT parametrised over service kind (`def` / `async def`) is not evidence. Our
  own round-6 confirmations declared `def` services and therefore confirmed a fix
  that does not hold on the lane our mandatory configuration requires.

* **`verifyM5` rows -- PRIMARY, BLOCKING.** `issues/verify-main-6db65d8/*.py`.
  Added by the round-8 pass (`49-r8-final-readiness-verdict.md`), covering the
  16 issues verified on `main` @ `6db65d8` -- the round-7 fix set #179-#190 plus
  the reopened #167/#168/#174/#175. Own named, commit-keyed set. Baseline at
  6db65d8: 15/16 PASS with exactly one expected FAIL (#174 -- DOCUMENTED-ONLY,
  no code changed, so the script correctly still reports the behaviour the
  documentation describes). Any FAIL outside that is a regression. Note that
  #167 PASSES in this set while it is allow-listed in the older `verifyM4` set:
  the sets are keyed on different commits on purpose and their allow-lists must
  not be merged.

  NOTE (round-8 standing amendment 13): a row that exercises a `send` and is NOT
  parametrised over issuer provenance (external vs issued from an action) AND
  chain state (untripped vs already tripped) is not evidence. R8-01 survived an
  upstream fix, a pinned upstream test and a full battle round because every
  existing test sent externally into an untripped chain. The general form of
  amendments 12 and 13: when a fix distinguishes two cases, the test must
  exercise both sides of the distinction -- and the arm expected to fail must be
  given work that can actually fail. A parametrised row whose arms are not
  equally capable of failing is not parametrised.

* **`verifyM7` rows -- PRIMARY, BLOCKING.** `issues/verify-main-19cb1f1/*.py`.
  Added by the round-10 pass (`59-r10-final-readiness-verdict.md`), covering the
  8 issues verified on `main` @ `19cb1f1` (merge of PR #211, commit `4dbf86e`)
  -- the round-9 fix set #203-#210. Own named, commit-keyed set. Baseline at
  19cb1f1: **8/8 PASS, NO expected failures.** Any FAIL is a regression.

  `203_*` and `204_*` are the load-bearing rows: they close round-9's two Highs
  (R9-02 `after` provenance, R9-04 SCXML s.6.1 `statesToInvoke`) on BOTH engines
  and BOTH service kinds, and their closure is what retires CV-C46 and CV-C45's
  send-side clause and what unblocks Phase-3 shim retirement. If either flips,
  reinstate both constraints before the order path runs.

  RETIRED FROM THIS SET (round 11): `206_delayed_selfsend_charged.py`. It
  asserts the #206 rule -- that a re-armed delayed self-send is charged per lap
  -- which **#212 deliberately reverses**. It was the SINGLE stable PASS->FAIL
  delta across the 163-check gate and the 527-script sweep at `c78ce99`, and it
  is category SUPERSEDED-BY-#212, not a regression. Left in place it becomes one
  permanent, meaningless blocking FAIL, which is how a reader is trained to
  ignore red. See `60-r11-regression.md` s.2 and `64-r11-final-readiness-verdict.md`
  s.2(b). The #212 rule is now asserted POSITIVELY by `verifyM8`'s `212_*` row.

* **`verifyM8` rows -- PRIMARY, BLOCKING.** `issues/verify-main-c78ce99/*.py`.
  Added by the round-11 pass (`64-r11-final-readiness-verdict.md`), covering the
  5 issues verified on `main` @ `c78ce99` (merge of PR #217, `fix/0.8.1-round10`)
  -- the round-10 fix set #212-#216. Own named, commit-keyed set. Baseline at
  c78ce99: **6/6 PASS, NO expected failures.** Any FAIL is a regression.

  Two SEMANTIC REVERSALS are pinned here, and both invert an earlier assertion:
  `212_*` pins that a `raise(delay=)` self-send is a TIMER (arming ends the
  step's chain; a self ping-pong of any period is legal periodic work), which
  SUPERSEDES #206; `213_*`/`214_*` pin snapshot layout **v3** with
  `scheduled_sends`, strict-on-restore, v2 upcast and `lane`. A future round
  that finds these rows failing must check whether the rule changed again before
  calling it a regression -- that is the whole lesson of the retired 206 row.

  NOTE (round-11 standing amendment 20): when a fix closes a constraint's
  ground, re-ground the constraint or retire it -- never carry it on the old
  justification. This set closed CV-C47's R10-03 ground (#212) and CV-C49's
  R10-04 ground (#213) in one release; CV-C47 was re-grounded on R11-04 and
  CV-C49 rewritten on R11-08, while CV-C48 retired outright.

  NOTE (round-10 standing amendment 16): a row asserting a SECURITY property
  must state the minimum capability it presumes and carry a CONTROL showing what
  that capability achieves WITHOUT the finding. Round 10 filed three
  Blocker/High candidates and all three fell to their own controls.

  NOTE (round-10 standing amendment 17): a row must demonstrate its own
  DISCRIMINATING POWER -- show the metric moving with the parameter it claims to
  bound. `209_*`'s paired `nested_invoke` shape never exits its initial state,
  so it agrees across all three lanes because a constant agrees with itself.

* **`verifyM6` rows -- PRIMARY, BLOCKING.** `issues/verify-main-f28719c/*.py`.
  Added by the round-9 pass (`54-r9-final-readiness-verdict.md`), covering the
  12 issues verified on `main` @ `f28719c` -- the round-8 fix set #192-#201 plus
  the reopened #181/#186. Own named, commit-keyed set. Baseline at f28719c:
  11/12 PASS with exactly one expected FAIL (#197 -- genuinely PARTIAL, the
  R9-08 residual). Any FAIL outside that is a regression.

  NOTE (round-9 standing amendment 14): where a row exercises a TRUST MECHANISM
  it must enumerate every call site the mechanism is meant to govern, not sample
  one. R9-02 exists because #195 minted three private engine event classes and
  wired two of them into transition selection -- a row checking only
  `done`/`error` reports the fix complete. A restore-path row must additionally
  exercise the RAW SERIALISED RECORD, not only the deserialised class: R9-02's
  decisive vector carries no "engine" flag and never meets a `send()`-time check
  at all.

  NOTE (round-9 standing amendment 15): a row must cite the doc sentence or spec
  clause it enforces, and a row whose citation and assertion disagree is a defect
  IN THE ROW. Upstream shipped both failure modes in one release --
  `test_always_rollforward_matches_sync` pins the behaviour its own docs say
  cannot happen, and `TestAsyncRollbackRearmCycleBounded` fails ~80% of runs on
  CORRECT behaviour by reading a counter at 0.6s when the `def` lane converges
  at ~1.0s. Corollary, binding on our scripts: assert convergence by POLLING to
  convergence, never by sleeping a guessed interval.

* **`repro` rows -- SECONDARY, INFORMATIONAL.** `issues/repro/LC-xx_*.py`, the
  original 0.7.0 scripts, which exercise the library **defaults**. They answer a
  different and still-useful question: *what does an unconfigured caller get?*
  A FAIL here is expected and is NOT counted in the exit code. Triage each one
  into `unfixed` / `fixed-but-opt-in` / `stale repro` in writing before citing it
  (`20-adoption-gate.md` s.9.2).

Both sets use the same convention: **exit 1 == the defect is still present**,
**exit 0 == the defect is gone**. The gate reports `PASS` only on exit 0.

* **probes/p0x** always exit 0; they self-report `N/M PASS` on the last line
  and write `probes/results/*.json`. The gate parses that JSON and compares the
  set of non-PASS probe ids against the recorded baseline
  (`PROBE_BASELINE_FAILURES`, currently the 0.8.0 baseline). A probe that newly
  regresses is a FAIL; a probe that newly passes is reported as IMPROVED.
* **bench/** scripts print `=== name ===` + a JSON blob. The gate extracts the
  metrics named in THRESHOLDS below and applies the documented pass rule.

A standing caveat on BENCH-1: it must be read **with the mandated policy block
armed**, where `actionErrorPolicy="rollback"` costs ~22% throughput. See
`20-adoption-gate.md` s.9.1.

Baselines are the measurements recorded in `04-performance-concurrency.md`,
`05-semantics-probes.md` (0.7.0) and `13-reeval-0.8.0-bench.md`,
`14-reeval-0.8.0-probes.md` (0.8.0) on the study machine. Benchmark thresholds
are hardware-sensitive: re-baseline on the target host before trusting a
marginal bench verdict (see `20-adoption-gate.md` s.6).

The baseline is keyed on a COMMIT, not a version string
-------------------------------------------------------
`20-adoption-gate.md` s.9.4 amendment 6. The current baseline build,
`main` @ `5327ba6`, reports `__version__ == "0.8.0"` while its CHANGELOG targets
0.8.1 -- so the version string cannot distinguish it from the release it
supersedes. This harness therefore resolves the git commit of the installed
clone (`library_commit()`), prints it, records it in the JSON, and compares it
against `BASELINE_COMMIT`. The version string is still reported, but it is
never the identity.

# #167/#168/#174/#175. Recorded baseline: 15 of 16 scripts exit 0.
#
# The single expected FAIL is **#174**, and it is expected BY DESIGN, not by
# concession: #174 was closed DOCUMENTED-ONLY -- no code changed -- so its script
# correctly still reports the behaviour it was written to detect (a plain-`def`
# service blocking its own machine's `after` timers, ~514 ms against a 100 ms
# budget). The documentation at `docs/_guide/production-characteristics.md:93`
# is the closure; the script is the evidence that the documentation is accurate.
# If this row ever flips to PASS, the behaviour changed and the docs are now

#
# NOT in this list, deliberately: nothing else. #167 PASSES here (it was the
# expected FAIL of the round-7 `verifyM4` set and is genuinely fixed at this

# #181/#186. Recorded baseline: 11 of 12 scripts exit 0.
#
# The single expected FAIL is **#197**, and it is expected because the issue is
# genuinely PARTIAL, not because the script is stale. The library's own pinned
# property test passes, but the reporter's original `always` + nested-final +
# `after` chart still returns a success-shaped `send(wait=True)` receipt over an
# empty configuration (`ok: true` while `get_persisted_snapshot()` REFUSES with
# SnapshotMidStepError at the same instant). That residual is carried as R9-08
# (Medium). If this row flips to PASS, R9-08 is fixed -- verify against
# `issues/post-f28719c/new/repro/R9-08_*.py` before closing it.
#
# NOTE, deliberately: this script is STRICTER than the gate's own `verifyM5`
# cell for the same issue number, which PASSes. The round-9 regression sweep
# (`50-r9-regression.md` s.2) flagged the disagreement; triage resolved it in
# favour of THIS script -- it carries an assertion the older cell lacks, and the
# assertion is the genuine defect signal. Do not "fix" the disagreement by
# weakening this one.

# Recorded `verifyM7` outcome on `19cb1f1` (round 10, 2026-09-22). This set is
# the 8 round-9 issues re-verified on that commit: #203-#210.
#
# Recorded baseline: **8 of 8 scripts exit 0 -- NO expected failures.** This is
# the first verification set in the study with a clean baseline, and that is a
# deliberate property, not an accident of scope: round 10 found every claimed
# fix landing on every axis it claimed (both engines, both service spellings).
# ANY FAIL in this set is a regression and must be triaged in writing.
#
# Two footnotes recorded so a later reader does not mistake them for slack:
#  - `209_*` sweeps two shapes and the paired `nested_invoke` one is INERT (it
#    never exits state `a`, fires exactly 2 calls at every limit 1-25 and can
#    never trip RunawayChainError). The discriminating `rollback_ondone` shape
#    carries the row. Standing amendment 17 -- do not read the second shape as
#    coverage, here or in the library's own tests/test_round9_findings.py.
#  - `207_*`'s reporter-side "failure" in the original report was under-waiting
#    after an async send(), not a regression. Poll to convergence.

# Recorded `verifyM8` outcome on `c78ce99` (round 11, 2026-09-22). This set is

#
# Recorded baseline: **6 of 6 scripts exit 0 -- NO expected failures.** Second
# consecutive verification set with a clean baseline, and as at round 10 that is
# a deliberate property: every claimed fix landed on every axis it claimed, both
# engines and both service spellings. ANY FAIL in this set is a regression and
# must be triaged in writing.
#
# Footnotes recorded so a later reader does not mistake them for slack:
#  - `212_*` pins the REVERSAL of #206. If a future round sees it fail, check
#    the CHANGELOG for another rule change BEFORE calling it a regression. The
#    retired `206_delayed_selfsend_charged.py` is the cautionary example.
#  - The five fixes are clean, but four carry SCOPE residuals that these rows do
#    NOT cover, because each is a defect in an ADJACENT surface rather than in
#    the fix: R11-06 (#215's descent gate hangs start() on a self-receipt
#    await), R11-07 (#216 checks the ROOT DICT ONLY -- 0/120 nested typos
#    caught), R11-08 (#213's records are dropped by restore->re-persist without
#    start()), R11-02/R11-10 (#214's strict check and its reporting do not reach
#    `scheduled_sends` / any plugin). A green verifyM8 is NOT evidence against
#    any of them; they are tracked in `63-r11-findings-register.md`.
VERIFYM8_BASELINE_FAILURES: List[str] = []

# Recorded `verifyM9` outcome on `de2da4e` (round 12, 2026-09-23). This set is
# the 5 round-11 issues re-verified on that commit: #218-#222, across 7 scripts
# (218 carries two, 221 carries two).
#
# Recorded baseline: **7 of 7 scripts exit 0 -- NO expected failures.** THIRD
# consecutive verification set with a clean baseline. ANY FAIL here is a
# regression and must be triaged in writing.
#
# Footnotes recorded so a later reader does not mistake them for slack:
#  - `219_*` pins a BREAKING CHANGE, not a bug fix. An in-step self-wait now
#    raises ReentrantWaitError on BOTH engines. If a future round sees this row
#    fail, check whether the guard's PREDICATE was narrowed (which is what
#    DE-L1 asks for) before calling it a regression -- a narrower predicate is
#    the requested outcome, and this row must then be rewritten, not reported.
#  - `222_*` pins the NEW sticky API (chain_trips / last_chain_error /
#    clear_chain_error / on_chain_budget_exceeded). `last_error` remains the
#    PER-STEP read it always was, BY DESIGN. Our own R11-09 repro tests the
#    oracle #222 retired and has been rewritten -- see RETIRED_OR_REWRITTEN.
#  - Only TWO residuals are not covered by these rows, and both are in an
#    ADJACENT surface rather than in the fix: DE-L1/Q-1 (#219's guard rides an
#    INHERITABLE ContextVar, so the documented ensure_future escape hatch is
#    refused whenever the spawning action yields again) and Q-5 (#220 does not
#    recurse into an inline-machine invoke.src). A green verifyM9 is NOT
#    evidence against either; both are tracked in
#    `69-r12-final-readiness-verdict.md` s.5.

    ONE BEHAVIOUR CHANGE lives here. `219_*` pins that an in-step
    send(..., wait=True) on an action's own interpreter RAISES
    ReentrantWaitError on BOTH engines, where it previously deadlocked. That is
    a BREAKING CHANGE for user actions, not a bug fix, and it is the reason

    predicate was NARROWED (the outcome DE-L1 requests), in which case the row

    Standing amendment 20 (round 11) fired hard this round and is restated:
    WHEN A FIX CLOSES A CONSTRAINT'S GROUND, RE-GROUND THE CONSTRAINT OR RETIRE
    IT. #218 closed the second and last ground of CV-C47 (R11-04, the unbounded
    _timer_handles leak) after #212 had closed its first (R10-03), so CV-C47
    and CV-C61 BOTH RETIRE -- the first retirement in this study driven by a
    defect being fixed at the mechanism rather than by a constraint being
    superseded. The handle-count gauge is kept as TELEMETRY, because it is what
    would detect a recurrence.

    Standing amendment 21 (round 12, NEW): A SUPERSEDED ORACLE IS NOT A
    REGRESSION, AND IT MUST BE RENAMED OR REWRITTEN IN THE ROUND THAT NOTICES
    IT. Round 11 retired the 206 row by renaming the file; round 12 spent zero
    triage on it, which is the whole argument. Two more of OUR scripts are
    superseded at this commit (R11-09 by #222, R11-07 by #220's fix landing) --
    see RETIRED_OR_REWRITTEN. Leave them and they become permanent meaningless
    reds.

    Standing amendment 22 (round 12, NEW): A ROW ASSERTING A BENCHMARK
    THRESHOLD MAY NOT BE SATISFIED BY ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE. BENCH-6 has been
    UNMEASURED for five consecutive rounds while CV-C12 stands on its stale
    number. `unmeasured` is not `met`; decision-table row 9 is refused on that
    basis, and `bench_c_timers` gets a DEDICATED time slice, first, before
    anything else in round 13.

    Standing amendment 23 (round 13, NEW): amendment 22 IS DISCHARGED, and the
    way it was discharged is the lesson. BENCH-6 was not merely unmeasured --
    it was being measured with THE WRONG TOOL. `bench_c_timers.py` does not
    reproduce upstream's "N busy machines" loaded-timer scenario at all, so
    five rounds of "still missed, 174.4 ms" were five rounds of a number that
    never addressed the question. BENCH-6 now runs `bench_c_timers_v2.py`,
    a thin wrapper over the library's OWN `benchmarks/production_characteristics.py
    --quick` section 2. Ten runs at v0.9.0: min 52.1 / p50 53.4 / p99 55.8 ms
    against a 100 ms bar -- MET, with ~44 ms headroom, every run under.
    CV-C12 (the `after` ban) retires to CV-C12' on the strength of it.
    The rule this leaves behind: when a threshold sits unmet for several
    rounds with no mechanism story, SUSPECT THE INSTRUMENT BEFORE THE LIBRARY.

    Standing amendment 24 (round 13, NEW): VERIFY_V090_DIR joins the primary
    set. Round 13 keys on the TAG (`v0.9.0` = 91bd979) rather than a branch
    commit, having first verified that `main` @ e3a1f22 differs from the tag
    only in CI config -- and, separately, that the PyPI wheel matches the tag
    across all 42 modules. A gate that decides on a tree which is not the
    artefact anyone installs is deciding on the wrong thing.
