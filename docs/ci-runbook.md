# CI/CD Runbook

> Owner: `area/infra-devops`. Source of truth for pipeline _operation_ — the
> pipeline's _shape_ is `docs/plan/27-adrs/ADR-0013-ci-pipeline.md` (binding
> rules 1–10); if this runbook and the ADR disagree, the ADR wins and this
> file is a bug — fix it in the same PR. Required check names are owned by
> `CONSTITUTION.md` C-9.1; this runbook does not restate that list.

## 1. Purpose

This is the document a person who did **not** write the pipeline uses to:
operate it day to day, understand what a red check means and how to fix it,
rebuild a dev environment from nothing, respond to a leaked secret, and
recover from a bad deploy. It exists because a pipeline only its author can
operate is a bus-factor risk (`docs/plan/32-risk-register.md` R10), and
because ADR-0013's own Validation section commits the team to running it,
measuring it and periodically breaking it on purpose.

## 2. Pipeline job map

## 3. Reading the `ci-required` resolver summary

`pr.yml`'s `ci-required` job is the only job branch protection actually
requires; every lane above feeds it. Read its job summary top to bottom:

- A lane with filter `false` and result `skipped` is **fine** — not
  applicable to this diff.
- A lane with filter `true` and result anything other than `success` is
  **CI-GATE-001** — the PR is genuinely red on an applicable lane; go to
  that lane's own log.
- A lane with filter `true` and result `skipped` is **CI-GATE-002** —
  "gate misconfiguration": the workflow itself is broken (a lane that
  should have run did not). This is a pipeline bug, not a PR bug — do not
  try to work around it; open an `infra-devops` issue.
- `CI-GATE-003` on `pin-check` means an action reference in `.github/workflows/**`
  is not pinned to a full commit SHA, or a workflow uses `pull_request_target`
  unsafely. Fix the reference; do not add an exception.

## 4. Triage recipes by error-code family

Each subsection below is the canonical target of the runbook-completeness
check (`scripts/check_runbook_completeness.py`, `CI-DOC-001`): every code
any workflow or `tools/ci`/`scripts` source can emit must have a heading
here, or the check fails the `governance` lane.

### CI-GATE-* — required-check resolver

- **CI-GATE-001** (applicable lane not successful): open the failing lane's
  log linked from the job summary; fix the underlying failure, do not touch
  the resolver.
- **CI-GATE-002** (gate misconfiguration): a required lane was skipped while
  its path filter said it applied. Compare `changed-paths` outputs against
  the lane's `if:` condition in `pr.yml`; this is almost always a filter/if
  mismatch introduced by an edit to `pr.yml` itself.
- **CI-GATE-003** (unpinned action / unsafe trigger): `tools/ci/check_action_pins.py`
  names the offending `uses:` line; replace the tag with the commit SHA
  GitHub shows for that release and keep the `# vX.Y.Z` comment.

### CI-JS-* — JS/TS lane

- **CI-JS-001** (`.nvmrc` vs `package.json#engines.node` mismatch): update
  whichever one is stale so both name the same Node major/minor; re-run
  `node tools/ci/check-node-version.mjs` locally.

### CI-GEN-* — generated-code freshness (`packages/protocol`)

- **CI-GEN-001** (drift): the working tree does not match `make gen`'s
  output. Run codegen locally, commit the regenerated files — never hand-edit
  `packages/protocol/src/generated`.
- **CI-GEN-002** (untracked generated output): codegen produced files `git
diff` cannot see because they were never tracked. `git add` them in the
  same commit as the schema change that introduced them.
- **CI-GEN-003** (non-deterministic generation): running the generator twice
  produced two different hashes. This is a generator bug (usually an
  unordered map/set iteration or a timestamp leaking into output) — file it
  against the generator, do not silence the check.
- **CI-GEN-004** (generator toolchain failure): the generator itself crashed
  (missing dependency, schema syntax error). Fix the schema or toolchain;
  the gate cannot pass on a generator that did not run.

### CI-CON-* — contract conformance

- **CI-CON-001** (OpenAPI structural validity / server-route drift): a route,
  field or schema in `docs/plan/22-api-openapi.yaml` no longer matches the
  implementation the contract test exercises. Fix the contract-first: update
  the YAML, regenerate, then adjust the handler — never patch the generated
  client to paper over a real drift.

### CI-INT-* — integration lane fixtures

- **CI-INT-001** (fixture unavailable): a fixture referenced by
  `services/api/tests/fixtures/bybit/**` (or its manifest) is missing on
  disk. Confirm it was committed (fixtures are never fetched over the
  network in CI) and that `tools/ci/verify_fixture_manifest.py`'s manifest
  entry path matches.
- **CI-INT-002** (checksum mismatch): the fixture bytes on disk do not match
  the manifest's recorded checksum — either a fixture was edited without
  regenerating its checksum, or it was silently corrupted. Recompute and
  commit the checksum only if the edit was deliberate and reviewed; otherwise
  restore the original fixture.

### CI-E2E-* / CI-A11Y-* — Playwright + accessibility

- **CI-E2E-001** (Playwright suite failed after retry): a spec failed twice
  (not a single flake). Open the uploaded JSON reporter artifact for the
  failing shard; reproduce locally with `pnpm --filter @candleviewer/web e2e`.
  If it fails intermittently across three runs in a week, quarantine per
  §9 (flaky-test process) rather than re-running indefinitely.
- **CI-E2E-002** (demo-REST-only tag matched zero specs): the
  `@demo-rest-only` Playwright tag used to assert demo-environment orders
  never go over WS matched no specs — either the tag was renamed/removed by
  accident or the harness itself regressed. This must never silently pass;
  restore the tag or the specs it should match.
- **CI-A11Y-001** (new serious/critical axe-core violation): open the axe
  report artifact, find the new violation's rule id and selector, fix the
  markup (see `docs/plan/05-accessibility-standard.md`) — never suppress a
  rule repo-wide to unblock one PR.

### CI-SEC-* — security scanning (`tools/ci/security_gate.py`)

- **CI-SEC-001** (blocking finding): a CodeQL/Semgrep/Bandit/pip-audit/
  npm-audit/gitleaks finding has no accepted-risk entry. Fix the finding.
  Gitleaks findings never get an accepted-risk exception (see the gate's own
  comment) — rotate the secret per `SECURITY.md` / IR-02 (§6 below) instead.
- **CI-SEC-002** (licence violation): a new dependency's licence is not on
  `tools/ci/licenses-allowlist.json`. Either drop the dependency, find an
  allowlisted alternative, or add the licence to the allowlist in its own
  reviewed PR with a justification comment — never in the PR that needs it.
- **CI-SEC-003** (LGPL needs approval): an LGPL-licensed dependency needs an
  explicit CODEOWNER approval recorded in the PR description before the
  gate will pass; tag the relevant CODEOWNER and wait for their review.
- **CI-SEC-004** (accepted-risk expired): a previously accepted finding's
  expiry date (C-12.3) has passed. Re-triage: either fix it now or renew the
  acceptance with a fresh, shorter expiry and a note on why it is still
  acceptable.
- **CI-SEC-005** (scanner infrastructure failure): a scanner produced no
  output at all (crashed, mis-configured, or a > 1 non-finding exit code).
  This never passes by default — check the scanner's own step log for a
  setup problem before assuming the codebase is clean.
- **CI-SEC-006** (unjustified or expired in-source Semgrep suppression): a
  `# nosemgrep` marker does not clear the gate unless the comment reads
  `nosemgrep: <rule-id>[,<rule-id>] reason=<r> owner=@<handle> review=YYYY-MM-DD`
  with a review date between today and today + 180 days (farther is
  `CI-SEC-006 expiry too far`). Fix the comment or fix the code; see
  `docs/plan/04-security-program.md` 12.2.

### CI-COV-* — coverage gate (`tools/ci/coverage_gate.py`)

- **CI-COV-001** (below floor): measured coverage for a package is below its
  floor in `tools/ci/coverage-baselines.json` (services/api ≥85%/75% branch,
  chart-engine ≥85%, apps/web & packages/ui ≥80% — CONSTITUTION §9 #3). Add
  tests; floors are never lowered to pass (C-9.4).
- **CI-COV-002** (baseline regression): coverage dropped below the recorded
  baseline minus tolerance even though it is still above the hard floor.
  Add tests to recover the baseline, or — only when the drop is a deliberate,
  reviewed removal of dead/duplicated tests — let the nightly
  `coverage-ratchet` job open a baseline-raise PR reviewing the new number.
- **CI-COV-003** (missing coverage artifact): a lane that should have
  produced a coverage report for an applicable package left none. Check
  that lane's upload step; a silently-missing report must never pass.

### CI-MIG-* — Alembic migration gate (`.github/workflows/_job-migrations.yml`,

`tools/ci/migration_lint.py`, C-5.1–C-5.6)

- **CI-MIG-000** (versions directory not found): the migration lint tool
  could not locate the Alembic `versions/` directory at the expected path.
  Check that the migration you added lives under the versions directory
  named in `docs/plan/21-database-schema.md`, and that the path was not
  moved without updating the lint tool's config.
- **CI-MIG-001** (multiple Alembic heads): `alembic heads` returned more
  than one head, meaning two migrations were parented off the same
  revision. Rebase onto `main`, re-`down_revision` your migration onto the
  new head so there is a single linear history (C-5.3), and re-run
  `alembic heads` locally to confirm exactly one head remains.
- **CI-MIG-002** (schema drift): `alembic check` found a mismatch between
  the SQLAlchemy models and the migration chain's resulting schema. Either
  a model changed without a matching migration, or a migration does not
  fully capture the model change. Autogenerate a diff (`alembic revision
--autogenerate`) and reconcile it into your migration by hand — never
  hand-edit an already-applied migration (C-5.4).
- **CI-MIG-003** (destructive operation without a `# cv:contract-phase:`
  annotation): the expand/contract linter found a drop/rename/narrowing
  operation with no phase annotation. Split the change into
  expand → migrate → contract across separate releases (C-5.1), and
  annotate the destructive statement with the phase comment the linter
  expects once you are genuinely in the contract phase.
- **CI-MIG-004** (upgrade-path failure): running the migration chain up
  from the previous release tag's schema failed. Reproduce locally
  (`alembic upgrade head` from a DB seeded at the previous tag) and fix the
  migration; this is separate from the round-trip check in CI-COV/CI-INT
  and exists specifically to catch assumptions about pre-existing data.
- **CI-MIG-005** (`IF NOT EXISTS` used in a migration): a migration file
  uses `IF NOT EXISTS`/`IF EXISTS` guards, which mask a wrong `down_revision`
  or a genuinely missing prior migration instead of failing loudly. Remove
  the guard and fix the actual ordering problem.
- **CI-MIG-006** (informational, non-blocking): a migration touches a table
  named in the audit-table list (C-5.7). This never fails the gate by
  itself — it is a flag for the reviewer to confirm no `UPDATE`/`DELETE`
  grant was added to an audit table.

### CI-IMG-* — container image supply chain (merge-to-main, `main.yml`)

- **CI-IMG-001** (unpinned base image): a `FROM` line in a Dockerfile is not
  pinned by digest. Pin it (`docker pull`, then `docker inspect --format
'{{index .RepoDigests 0}}'`) and commit the `@sha256:...` reference.
- **CI-IMG-002** (root user): the built image runs as root. Add a non-root
  `USER` directive; verify locally with `docker run --rm <image> id`.
- **CI-IMG-003** (Trivy High/Critical): a High/Critical CVE was found in the
  built image. Update the affected package/base image; if genuinely
  unfixable short-term, this needs the same accepted-risk process as
  CI-SEC-004, not a bypass.
- **CI-IMG-004** (cosign verification failed): the pushed image's signature
  did not verify against the expected keyless-OIDC identity. Treat as a
  supply-chain incident — do not deploy the image; re-run the build from a
  clean checkout and re-verify before investigating further.
- **CI-IMG-005** (SBOM generation/validation failed): `syft`'s CycloneDX
  output failed structural validation. Check the `syft` step log for a
  parse/tool error; the gate refuses to sign an image with no valid SBOM.

### CI-SPIKE-* — spike containment (`tools/ci/check_spike_containment.py`)

- **CI-SPIKE-001** (throwaway prototype code reaching `main`): a path under
  a spike directory is present on a non-spike branch. Per C-4.5, spikes end
  in a written finding and are deleted — remove the prototype path from this
  branch; if code from the spike is genuinely being promoted, move it
  through a normal ticket, not by leaving the spike directory in place.
- **CI-SPIKE-002** (promoted benchmark harness imports from a spike path):
  a "real" benchmark still imports from the throwaway spike location.
  Copy the needed code into its permanent home and update the import.

### CI-PROT-* — branch-protection governance (`scripts/check_bypass_register.py`)

- **CI-PROT-004** (bypass register stale/empty/malformed): `.github/rulesets/bypass-register.md`
  has a row with a passed or too-far-future review date, is missing rows
  entirely, or is malformed. Add/update the row with a review date no more
  than one quarter (91 days) out, or remove a bypass actor that is no
  longer needed. See §5 for the break-glass procedure this register backs.

### CI-REL-* — release automation

- **CI-REL-001** (unparseable changelog fragment / non-conventional PR
  title): the PR has neither a conventional-commit title nor a parseable
  `Changelog:` footer. Fix the title, or add a footer line matching the
  format documented in `tools/ci/changelog_lib.py`'s docstring.
- **CI-REL-002** (1.0.0-explicit-declaration guard): the computed next
  version would cross into `1.0.0` without an explicit, reviewed
  declaration commit. This is deliberate friction — open the declaration PR
  named in the gate's error message first.
- **CI-REL-003** (release-binary signing parity): the Electron installer
  signing step did not produce a signature matching the image-signing
  parity requirement. Check the cosign keyless step log for an OIDC/identity
  mismatch.
- **CI-REL-004** (PRR gate unchecked): the draft release stays a draft while
  the PRR checklist item on the release-checklist issue is unchecked. This
  is not a bug — do not publish manually; complete the PRR checklist
  (`docs/plan/07-release-and-prr.md` §5) and let the checklist gate lift it.

### CI-DEP-* — dev/staging deploy (`tools/ci/deploy_dev.py`, §8)

- **CI-DEP-001** (signature verification failed): `cosign verify` did not
  accept the target digest against the expected OIDC identity/issuer.
  Deployment aborts before any container is replaced; the ledger records
  `signature-verification-failed`. Never re-run with `--no-...` to bypass
  this — investigate why `main.yml`'s own sign step produced (or the
  registry served) an unverifiable digest.
- **CI-DEP-002** (smoke test failed / timed out): `/healthz` or `/readyz`
  never returned `status: "ok"` within the timeout. On dev this triggers
  automatic redeploy of the last known-good digest (`rolled-back` ledger
  entry); on staging it stops and alerts — roll back manually (§8). Check
  the container logs for a stuck boot-time migration (advisory lock,
  E03-T10) first; a long CI-DEP-002 wait is often a CI-DEP-004 in disguise.
- **CI-DEP-003** (sha mismatch after deploy): the container came up healthy
  but `/healthz`'s `git_sha` never matched the digest we just deployed —
  "deploy succeeded, old image still running". Check that the compose
  service actually pulled the new digest (`docker compose images`) rather
  than reusing a cached local tag.
- **CI-DEP-004** (migration lock timeout): the boot-time Alembic advisory
  lock (E03-T10) did not release within its own timeout, so the container
  never reaches `/readyz`. Surfaces here as a CI-DEP-002 smoke timeout;
  check the API container's boot logs for the lock-wait message.

### CI-DOC-* — documentation drift (this runbook's own gate)

- **CI-DOC-001** (undocumented error code): `scripts/check_runbook_completeness.py`
  found a `CI-<FAMILY>-<NNN>` code emitted by a workflow or `tools/ci`/
  `scripts` source with no matching heading in this file. Add a subsection
  under §4 for the new code (copy the pattern above: what it means, how to
  fix it) in the **same PR** that introduced the emitting code — this is
  the mechanical enforcement of "a pipeline change ships with its own docs".

## 5. Secret-exposure response

A secret (API key, token, credential, signature) found in a commit, log,
artifact or screenshot is an incident, not a cleanup task:

1. **Rotate first, always** — per `SECURITY.md` / IR-02 (SR-143), rotating
   the credential at the source (Bybit key management, the secrets store)
   comes before any git-history surgery. A secret that was ever pushed is
   assumed compromised even after a force-push or history rewrite.
2. Follow `SECURITY.md`'s reporting path — never open a public issue
   (C-12.13).
3. If CI itself surfaced the leak (gitleaks, `CI-SEC-001`), the finding
   never gets an accepted-risk exception (§4 CI-SEC-*) — the PR cannot merge
   until the secret is gone from every commit in the branch and rotated.
4. After rotation, `git filter-repo` (or equivalent) removal from history is
   a follow-up hygiene step, not the fix — do it only after rotation is
   confirmed, coordinating with `@basiltt` since it rewrites shared history.

## 6. Quarterly action-pin and workflow-permission review (SR-132)

A recurring review with no scheduled owner does not happen, so it is a
GitHub issue template, not a calendar reminder someone might miss:

- Template: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/quarterly-ci-review.yml` (added by this
  ticket). Filing cadence: first business day of Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct.
- Checklist covers: every `uses:` action reference is still pinned to a SHA
  matching its documented tag (cross-check `.github/actions-pins.md`); every
  workflow's `permissions:` block is least-privilege for what that workflow
  actually does; the self-hosted GPU runner's isolation/ephemeral-workspace
  posture (ADR-0013 risk note) is still correct; the bypass register (§4
  CI-PROT-004) has no stale rows.
- The **first occurrence is scheduled** for **2026-10-01** (a
  `quarterly-ci-review`-labelled issue filed against `@CandleViewer/devsecops`,
  tracked in the same GitHub Project as regular tickets).

## 7. Dev environment rebuild from scratch (PRR-lite)

For an engineer with repository access and no prior context. If a step
below is found to be missing or wrong while actually following it, fix this
section in the same sprint — do not just work around it and move on.

1. Clone the repo; install the pinned toolchain: Node version from
   `.nvmrc`, `pnpm` via `corepack enable`, Python 3.12/3.13 via `uv`
   (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` or the platform
   equivalent), Docker (for Postgres/QuestDB/testcontainers-backed suites).
2. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` at the repo root.
3. `uv sync --project services/api` (installs the pinned Python deps from
   `services/api/uv.lock`).
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`; never fill in real exchange credentials —
   local/dev defaults use fixture data and demo-only stubs, never a live key.
5. Bring up the local stack: `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
   (Postgres, QuestDB — once `infra/` ships its compose file per its owning
   epic; until then this step is N/A and the smoke test in step 6 is
   frontend/backend-unit-only).
6. Smoke test: `pnpm verify` (JS/TS lint+typecheck+unit) and, from
   `services/api`, `uv run pytest -m "not exchange_smoke"`. Both must exit 0
   on a fresh clone before the rebuild counts as done.
7. Start the app locally per `AGENTS.md` §4's command table (owned there;
   not restated here) once the relevant app-runner ticket has landed.

## 8. Rollback of a bad dev/staging deploy

- Dev auto-deploys via `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml` on every green
  `main.yml` run (`workflow_run` trigger); staging deploys via
  `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`, `workflow_dispatch` or a
  `release/*` push, gated on the `staging` GitHub Environment (required
  reviewers + a deployment branch policy restricting it to `main`/
  `release/*`, SR-141). Both call `tools/ci/deploy_dev.py`, which
  `cosign verify`s the digest immediately before applying it, renders
  `infra/compose/.env` from `infra/compose/.env.example`, runs
  `docker compose ... up -d --wait`, smoke-tests `/healthz` + `/readyz` and
  asserts the deployed `git_sha` matches, then appends a record to
  `deployments/ledger.jsonl` (sha, digest, environment, actor, timestamp,
  outcome, duration) — committed by the workflow for auditability until
  E04's observability lands.
- **Dev** auto-rolls-back on a failed smoke test: the previous `success`
  ledger entry's digest is looked up and redeployed automatically. Both
  outcomes (`smoke-failed` then `rolled-back`) land in the ledger.
- **Staging never auto-rolls-back** (a half-rolled-back staging environment
  mid-soak is harder to reason about than a stopped one) — a failed smoke
  test stops the job; roll back manually by dispatching
  `deploy-staging.yml` with `rollback_to_digest` set to the previous
  digest (find it via `grep '"environment":"staging"' deployments/ledger.jsonl | tail -5`
  or the digest recorded in `main.yml`'s `image-supply-chain-evidence`
  artifact / SBOM-diff job summary).
- Rollback never runs a down-migration (ADR-0013 rule 9): migrations are
  additive expand/contract, so redeploying an older image against the
  current schema is always safe; the deploy script does not invoke
  `alembic downgrade`.
- Never roll back by editing the running container in place — always
  redeploy a previously-built, previously-scanned image by digest.
- Production is a deliberate, checklisted action (ADR-0013 rule 8) and is
  out of scope here; see `docs/plan/07-release-and-prr.md` §4 for the
  release checklist and rollback procedure at that stage.

## 9. Flaky-test quarantine process

- ADR-0013 binding rule 10: a job that fails then passes on retry is
  recorded; three occurrences in a week auto-open a quarantine issue.
- On a quarantine issue: mark the test `@flaky` (Python) or `.fixme`/skip
  annotation with a linked issue (TypeScript/Playwright) within 24 hours
  (C-9.3) — never silently delete a flaky test to make CI green.
- The quarantine issue is `priority/p1-high`, assigned to the area owner of
  the flaky test's package, and stays open until the root cause is fixed and
  the test is un-quarantined in the same PR that fixes it.

## 10. Weekly PR-feedback-time report

- Job: `.github/workflows/ci-metrics-report.yml` (added by this ticket),
  scheduled weekly (Monday 06:00 UTC) and runnable on demand
  (`workflow_dispatch`).
- Reads the `ci-metrics` artifacts (per-run wall-clock time from
  PR-opened/updated to the `ci-required` resolver's conclusion, emitted by
  `pr.yml` since `E03-T01`) for the trailing 7 days and publishes p50/p90 as
  a job summary table.
- **Rebalance trigger**: if p90 > 15 minutes (ADR-0013's target), the report
  emits a `::warning::` annotation naming the rebalance instruction —
  "review the job matrix's path filters and the slowest lane in this run;
  either narrow that lane's trigger conditions or split it" — and opens (or
  comments on) a standing `priority/p2-medium` `area/infra-devops` issue
  tracking the rebalance so it is not lost.
- Budget: the report job itself must complete in ≤60s (this ticket's own
  Performance note); it fails loudly (not silently) if the `ci-metrics`
  artifact for a given week is entirely absent, since a missing metric is
  itself worth flagging, not treating as "zero incidents".

## 11. ADR-0013 validation log

Dated record of the two validation exercises the ADR's own Validation
section requires. Append a new dated entry here every time either exercise
is re-run (e.g. after a significant pipeline change) — never overwrite a
previous entry.

| Date       | Exercise                                                                                              | Result                                                                  | Evidence                                                                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## 12. Benchmark manual-override procedure

- The GPU benchmark lane (`_job-engine-bench.yml`, filled in by `E03-T14`)
  compares against a pinned baseline on a pinned self-hosted runner
  (ADR-0013 rule 4). If that runner is genuinely unavailable (hardware
  failure, maintenance window):
  1. The Architect records an explicit manual-override approval as a PR
     comment naming the reason and expected restoration date.
  2. The PR's benchmark check is treated as non-blocking only for that one
     PR, never repo-wide and never by editing the workflow's `if:` condition.
  3. The override is itself logged in this runbook's validation log (§11)
     as a dated entry so overrides are visible history, not silent bypasses.
- Baseline updates (as opposed to overrides) always need CODEOWNER approval
  and a written justification per ADR-0013 rule 4 — never conflate "the
  runner was down" with "the baseline should move".

## Credential hygiene and full-history sweep (E43-T06)

- `python scripts/check_secrets_hygiene.py all` (CI `gitleaks` job): fixtures carry the `DUMMYKEY_`
  prefix (SR-145), `.env` ignored and `.env.example` non-secret (SR-144), no `set -x`/env dumps in
  workflows (SR-146). `inventory <names.json>` and `logs <paths>` back the secret-inventory (SR-140/141)
  and log/artefact scans.
- Full-history sweep (run by the owner/DevSecOps before the pen-test; gitleaks is not installed on
  agent hosts): `gitleaks detect --source . --log-opts="--all" --config .gitleaks.toml --redact -r sweep.json`
  then `gitleaks detect --no-git ...`; record ruleset version, result and per-hit disposition in
  `docs/plan/spikes`-style note. Any real hit: **rotate first** (IR-02, SR-143), then investigate.

### Sweep record (executed 2026-10-03, gitleaks 8.30.1, ruleset = repo `.gitleaks.toml` on top of defaults)

- Full history (`--log-opts="--all"`, 1037 commits): 16 findings, **0 real credentials**. Dispositions:
  3x `generic-api-key` in `pr1611.diff` (commit 59f75058) = deliberate `CANARY*`/`hunter2-CANARY` test canaries;
  2x `generic-api-key` `docs/plan/threat-models/E05-design-system.md:190` = prose false positive;
  2x `aws-access-token` `.semgrep/tests/cv-secret-shaped-literal.py:7` = an AWS-shaped Semgrep rule-test
  literal (intentionally secret-shaped); 1x `rest_models.py:2143` = generated `max_length=36` description text;
  8x `docs/plan/{14,22,23}-*` = documentation examples (truncated JWT `eyJ...`, `mfa_`/`arm_` sample ids).
  No rotation required (IR-02 not triggered). The `gitleaks` CI job now also runs a full-history gitleaks sweep,
  `trufflehog filesystem` and `trufflehog git` (image pinned by digest; output is detector, file:line, commit,
  verified only). First CI run triage ([run 37080326323](https://github.com/basiltt/CandleViewer/actions/runs/37080326323)),
  all `verified=false`, no rotation:

  | Detector         | Location (mode)                                                   | Hits | Disposition                                                  |
  | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Postgres         | `test_boot_advisory_lock_unit.py:121,126,141` (fs + git 8e8443cc) | 6    | test vector (dummy `u`/`h`/`d` DSN)                          |
  | Postgres         | `test_health_probes.py:67` (fs + git edabeaa2)                    | 2    | test vector (redaction test DSN)                             |
  | Postgres         | `test_health_report_router.py:71` (fs + git edabeaa2)             | 2    | test vector (redaction test DSN)                             |
  | Github           | `.git/config:12` (fs)                                             | 1    | false positive: checkout's ephemeral job token, runner state |
  | Github, Postgres | `trufflehog-fs.log:1-2` (fs)                                      | 2    | false positive: scanner self-scan of its own output          |

  Counts by class: test vector 10, false positive 3 (incl. the Postgres self-scan line), REAL 0. Path-specific excludes with
  reasons live in `.trufflehog-exclude`; raw output moved to `$RUNNER_TEMP` so it is never self-scanned.

- A committed secret fails `security_gate.py --tool gitleaks` (CI-SEC-001), whose output and a `::error` annotation cite IR-02.
- GitHub inventory (`gh api repos/.../actions/secrets|variables|environments`): 0 repository secrets, 0
  variables, 0 environments. CI therefore holds **no production credential** (SR-140). `TURBO_TOKEN`, `PROJECTS_PAT` and
  `GH_BRANCH_PROTECTION_TOKEN` are referenced by workflows but not provisioned (owner to scope them to an environment when added). When release secrets are introduced they MUST live in a protected
  `release` environment with required reviewers and use OIDC (no long-lived cloud keys); `check_inventory`
  fails any prod-credential or repo-scoped release secret name.
  Re-run 2026-10-03 (`gh api .../actions/secrets`, `/variables`, `/environments`; names only): still 0/0/0. No long-lived
  cloud credentials present; OIDC conversion (SR-141) n/a, evidenced by the empty inventory.
- SR-146: the `gitleaks` job runs `check_secrets_hygiene.py all` and scans its own log/artefact outputs
  (`logs`), covered by a leaky-job test. Scope: it scans the job's report/log files in the workspace
  (`*.json`, `*.log`, `*.sarif`), not the hosted Actions log stream itself.
