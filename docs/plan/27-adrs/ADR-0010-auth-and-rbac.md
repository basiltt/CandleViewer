## Context and problem statement

CandleViewer serves one owner plus a few account managers and reviewers. Managers must be able to trade their assigned sub-accounts and must not be able to see anyone else's. The owner needs administration — users, roles, Bybit accounts, API keys, per-account profiles, feature flags, recorder policy, audit log, system health — and a kill-switch. The planning brief forbids a separate admin application: admin is RBAC-gated screens inside the same web app. Remote access is Tailscale-only. No retail product researched documents fine-grained RBAC for this use case, so the design is bespoke.

## Decision drivers

- Manager isolation is a money-and-trust boundary, not a UI preference.
- The frontend must never be trusted for scope, environment or risk caps (principle P8).
- One app, one deployment, one set of screens (planning brief).
- The backend contract must remain client-agnostic so a mobile client can be added later.
- The system is reachable only over a WireGuard mesh, but network isolation is not authentication.

## Considered options

1. **Server-side sessions (cookie) + mandatory TOTP + a central scope resolver; admin as RBAC-gated routes in the same SPA.**
2. **JWT access/refresh tokens in browser storage.**
3. **OIDC via an external identity provider** (Authentik/Keycloak).
4. **Tailscale identity as the sole authentication** (trust the mesh).

## Decision outcome

**Chosen: option 1.**

1. **Authentication** — password (Argon2id, per-user salt plus a pepper derived from the KEK) **and** mandatory TOTP (RFC 6238, 30 s step, ±1 window, single-use recovery codes). Lockout after 5 failures in 15 minutes, with an audit entry and an owner notification.
2. **Sessions** — opaque server-side sessions in Postgres; cookie is `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`, path-scoped. Absolute lifetime 12 h, idle timeout 60 min, rotation on any privilege change, revoke-all on password or TOTP change. No JWT in `localStorage` — an XSS bug must not yield a portable, unrevocable credential.
3. **CSRF** — `SameSite=Strict` plus a double-submit token on every state-changing request; the WS handshake validates `Origin`.
4. **Roles** — `Owner` (full administration, all accounts, global kill-switch), `Manager` (trade and view only their assigned accounts), `Viewer` (read-only over a granted scope, including the audit log and journal). Roles are coarse by design; the fine-grained dimension is the **account scope**.
5. **Central scope resolver** — a single `ScopeResolver` maps user → role → allowed account ids → allowed key ids. **Every** REST route and **every** WS subscription passes through it. There is exactly one implementation, so there is exactly one place isolation can be wrong, and it is covered by a contract test that asserts 403 for every cross-scope route and topic.
6. **Admin inside the app** — admin routes live under `/admin/*` in `apps/web`, gated by role at the router level *and* independently at every API endpoint. The client-side gate is a UX affordance only; the server gate is the security control.
7. **Environment as an authorisation dimension** — every trading request carries its environment and is rejected server-side on mismatch. Demo→Live switching requires typed confirmation, is never hotkey-driven, and is audited.
8. **Kill-switch** — Owner-only FREEZE per manager or globally, enforced in the OMS `Validator` before any adapter call, so it cannot be bypassed by a modified client or a stale session.
9. **Audit** — hash-chained, append-only (`INSERT`-only role; `UPDATE`/`DELETE` revoked): auth events, key events, order actions, rule firings, admin changes, environment switches, kill-switch activations. Owner and Viewer may read; nobody may mutate.
10. **Transport** — Tailscale is a network control, not an authentication control; it is defence in depth beneath the application session, never a substitute.

### Consequences

Positive:
- Sessions are revocable instantly and centrally — important when a manager relationship ends.
- One resolver means isolation is testable exhaustively rather than reviewed hopefully.
- One application to build, style, test and accessibility-audit, per the planning brief.
- Mandatory TOTP meaningfully raises the bar even if a password leaks.

Negative / risks:
- Server-side sessions require a database round-trip per request (mitigated by a short-lived in-process cache with explicit invalidation on revoke) and mean Postgres downtime blocks login — acceptable, since Postgres downtime already blocks order entry.
- Admin screens inside the trading app widen the SPA's blast radius if an XSS bug appears. Mitigated by a strict CSP, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (lint-enforced), `HttpOnly` cookies, Electron context isolation, and a pen-test before Live enablement.
- Bespoke RBAC means no off-the-shelf audit of the model. Mitigated by the contract test suite and an explicit STRIDE threat model per epic.

### Why not the alternatives

- **JWT in browser storage**: not revocable without a server-side blocklist (at which point it is a session with extra steps), and directly XSS-exfiltratable.
- **External OIDC provider**: another stateful service to run, back up and secure on a single box for fewer than ten users; it also adds a hard dependency that can block login while positions are open.
- **Tailscale identity alone**: a single compromised or unlocked device would grant full trading authority with no second factor and no per-user scope inside the app. Rejected outright.

## Validation

- Contract tests: for every route and every WS topic, a Manager outside scope receives 403 and an audit entry, with no adapter call made.
- Session tests: absolute/idle expiry, rotation on privilege change, revoke-all on credential change, CSRF rejection, `Origin` validation on the WS handshake.
- DAST (OWASP ZAP) in CI against the authenticated surface; pen-test before Live enablement (R4).

## Implementation notes (2026-10-09)

Added by E09-K02. Additive: the decision above stands and is not reopened. This section records what
the code on `main` (`d9143fb`) does, so a reader can tell decision from detail. Facts come from the
code and from `docs/security/reviews/e09-auth-review.md` (E09-X04). Items marked *pending owner
decision* are not settled here. Paths are under `services/api/candleviewer/`.

### As implemented

- **Argon2id** (`auth/hashing.py`): `m=65536` KiB, `t=3`, `p=4`, via `argon2-cffi`; the parameters
  are stored per user in `users.password_algo_params`, and `needs_rehash` upgrades a hash at the next
  login (`auth/login_service.py`). The pepper (`settings.auth_pepper`) is appended to the password
  before hashing. A fixed dummy hash is verified for unknown identifiers so timing is uniform. The
  reference host these were calibrated on, and the on-host cost, are **not recorded**: the ≥100 ms
  check is open as #2097.
- **Session lifetimes** (`auth/session_service.py`): 12 h absolute; 12 min opaque access token
  (ADR-0020); idle lock 15 min by default, per-session `idle_timeout_s`, clamped to 5–60 min. The
  decision text above says 60 min idle; the code is stricter.
- **Lockout** (`auth/login_service.py`): 5 failures, 15 min.
- **Step-up** (`auth/step_up.py`): action classes `keys`, `users`, `live_enablement`, `killswitch`,
  `risk_caps`; 5 min grace, none for `live_enablement` and `killswitch`; 3 wrong codes make the
  session read-only for 5 min.
- **Rotation points that exist**: refresh (new session row, old marked `rotated`, reuse revokes the
  whole family), and the session minted on MFA completion. **Not present**: rotation on role change
  and on step-up (#2101), and on password change (route missing, #2110). The decision text says
  "rotation on any privilege change"; that is not yet true.
- **Session cache**: the decision text mentions a short-lived in-process cache with explicit
  invalidation. The review found no such cache in `auth/`; every request reads the session
  (`authenticate_access_token`). Revocation reaches live sockets through `ws/revocation.py`.
  Role changes push a `permission_change` to sockets (`api/users.py`).
- **Permission vocabulary**: `x-rbac` blocks in `22-api-openapi.yaml` are the source;
  `tools/rbac/generate.py` writes `auth/generated_permissions.py` and the `permissions` list of
  `auth/rbac_seed.json`; CI `generated-code` runs it with `--check`. Role-to-permission mapping is
  hand-authored in `rbac_seed.json`.
- **Two-layer authorisation**: deny-by-default plus `x-rbac` (`api/deny_by_default.py`), then
  `auth/scopes.py` (`decide`, `enforce`). The last active Owner cannot be demoted
  (`auth/owner_floor.py`).
- **Audit read grants** were aligned with `04-security-program.md` §7.2 / SR-067 in #2083 (fixed in
  #2095). Verify and export are Owner only (`audit/access.py`).

### Deviations from the decision or from the security programme

| Id | Fact | Status |
|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Recovery codes are stored as a keyed HMAC-SHA256 of the normalised code (`auth/recovery_codes.py`; about 138 bits of entropy), not Argon2id as SR-022 states. | **Resolved** — owner decision #1778 AD (2026-10-09): keep HMAC-SHA256 with a server-side pepper; codes are high-entropy random so a slow KDF is unnecessary. SR-022 text amended in `04-security-program.md`. |
| D-2 | Step-up verifies a TOTP code only (`auth/step_up.py`); SR-025 asks for password plus TOTP. | pending owner decision (#1778 item AE) |
| F-1 | No CSRF double-submit token. Decision 3 above calls for one. The code relies on `SameSite=Strict`, the Origin allow-list and the bearer-header model. | open, fix or Owner-signed acceptance (#2090) |
| F-2 | Access tokens are not bound to IP or user-agent; theft is detected only on refresh-token reuse. | design decision, pending owner decision |

Both decision and code remain as stated until the owner decides; this section does not choose.
