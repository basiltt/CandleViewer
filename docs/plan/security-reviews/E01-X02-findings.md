# E01-X02 — Security review of governance automation: findings report

- Ticket: E01-X02 (issue #141), blocked_by E01-T07 (merged #1436), E01-X01 (merged #1411)
- Scope: workflows and scripts shipped by E01 only — `.github/workflows/board-automation.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/governance.yml`, `.github/workflows/governance-drift.yml`,
  `scripts/gh/**` (guard implementation). E03's pipeline workflows are out of scope (E03's own
  security review covers them, per this ticket's "Out of scope" section).
- Method: static read of the workflow YAML + guard source against `04-security-program.md`
  §6.13/§6.14/§6.17 and the E01-X01 threat list, plus execution of the guard decision logic's unit
  test suite (`scripts/gh/tests/`, 73 tests, all green) as the available proxy for the abuse cases
  below. **Deviation** (recorded per "Agent-delivery adaptations"): a live scratch-repository dynamic
  run (as originally scoped) requires creating and instrumenting a second GitHub repository and firing
  real `issues` webhook events against it; that is out of reach of this session (no interactive GitHub
  access beyond this repo's `gh` token, no docker). ADR-0017 (E01-K01) already performed exactly this
  class of scratch-repo probe for the underlying credential/event questions and its verbatim evidence is
  reused below rather than re-run. Every abuse case that has a corresponding unit test is executed here;
  the two that are genuinely only checkable via a live GitHub event (the actual close-then-reopen race,
  and a workflow literally being disabled) are marked **not executed this session** with the existing
  detective control identified in lieu of fresh evidence, and filed as a explicit follow-up rather than
  silently assumed to hold.

## 1. Permission-block audit (SR-132, SR-164)

| Workflow             | Job                  | Declared `permissions`            | Scopes used by steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Verdict                 |

| governance.yml       | (workflow root)      | `contents: read`                  | no job-level override — single job, read-only checks, no write step anywhere in the job                                                                                                                                                                              | OK                      |
| governance-drift.yml | (workflow root)      | `contents: read`, `issues: write` | drift script reads via `GH_BRANCH_PROTECTION_TOKEN` (a _secret_, not the `permissions:` block — that secret is a separate, more-privileged PAT by design, see §3); `issues: write` used only by the `actions/github-script` step that opens a drift issue on failure | OK, no unused scope     |

No job declares `write-all` or omits a `permissions:` block (which would fall back to the
repository default). **SR-132/SR-164: PASS.**

## 2. Action pinning audit (SR-132)

`grep -n "uses:" .github/workflows/*.yml` across all E01-owned workflow files: every third-party
action reference (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-python`, `actions/github-script`) is pinned to a
full 40-hex-char commit SHA with a trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment. The only non-SHA `uses:` references in
the repo are local reusable-workflow calls (`./.github/workflows/_job-*.yml`, in `pr.yml`, which is
E03-owned and out of scope) — those are same-repo files, not third-party actions, so pinning does not
apply to them. **No floating tag or branch reference found in E01's workflows. SR-132 (pinning half): PASS.**

**F-2 (P2, accepted with follow-up):** `scripts/requirements-ci.txt` (installed by `governance.yml`
L33 via `python -m pip install --quiet -r scripts/requirements-ci.txt`) pins each package with `==`
but carries no `--hash` entries, so `pip install` does not verify package integrity against a known
digest — only the version is pinned, not the artifact. This is a real gap against the ticket's
"hashed, pinned dependency list" requirement for the Python setup; it does not raise the overall
audit to FAIL because the install runs in `governance.yml`'s `pull_request` job, which (per §4) gets
a fork-safe, secret-less, read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` — so a compromised/typosquatted package here has no
credential or write access to exfiltrate, bounding the blast radius to the ephemeral read-only runner.
Accepted as a documented gap, not silently passed: follow-up is to generate a `pip-compile --generate-hashes`
(or equivalent `hashin`) lockfile for `scripts/requirements-ci.txt` and switch the install step to
`pip install --require-hashes -r scripts/requirements-ci.txt`, tracked as a new backlog chore ticket
(owner: infra-devops) rather than done inline in this review PR, since it changes a shared CI input
file and belongs in its own small PR per this repo's multi-agent file-ownership rule.

## 3. Credential inventory (owner: `04-security-program.md` §6.14 — appended there in this PR)

**Credential preference-order check (per ticket's Technical notes):** `PROJECTS_PAT` is a fine-grained
PAT, not a classic PAT — **no P1 finding** on this axis. A GitHub App installation token was considered
and rejected in ADR-0017 with a documented rationale (single-owner repo, disproportionate operational
overhead) rather than skipped by omission — acceptable per the ticket's own preference-order note, which
ranks fine-grained PAT above classic PAT and only marks classic PAT as an automatic P1.

**Administration-credential reachability check:** confirmed `GH_BRANCH_PROTECTION_TOKEN` is referenced
by exactly one workflow (`governance-drift.yml`), whose triggers are `schedule` and `workflow_dispatch`
only — never `pull_request`/`pull_request_target`/`issues`. **PASS** on the ticket's explicit
requirement that this credential never be reachable from an automatic PR trigger.

## 4. Fork-safety / trigger-vs-secret reachability matrix

| Workflow             | Trigger(s)                                     | Uses `pull_request_target`? | Checks out untrusted (fork PR head) ref?                                                                                                                    | Secret referenced                   | Reachable from a fork-originated event?                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| board-automation.yml | `issues: [opened, labeled, unlabeled, closed]` | No                          | No (no PR checkout at all; `actions/checkout` here checks out the default branch only, used solely to get `scripts/gh/**` onto the runner)                  | `PROJECTS_PAT` (kind-sync job only) | `issues` events are repo-scoped, not fork-PR-scoped; a fork cannot open an "issue" against the base repo in a way that carries attacker-controlled _workflow_ content — only issue title/body text, which is handled as data (see §5) | No                                                                         |

**No workflow combines `pull_request_target` with checkout of the PR head. No secret is referenced in a
job reachable from a fork-originated event. SR-165 / Gherkin scenario "No secret is reachable from an
untrusted trigger": PASS.**

## 5. Script-injection audit (Gherkin: "Issue content cannot inject shell commands")

`grep -rn "github.event\..*\.body\|github.event\..*\.title" .github/workflows/` across all three
E01-owned workflow files returns **zero matches** — no `run:` block interpolates
`${{ github.event.issue.body }}`, `${{ github.event.issue.title }}` or any similar user-controlled
field directly into a shell command. The only values passed via `env:` (the required-safe pattern) are
`ISSUE_NUMBER` (an integer from `github.event.issue.number`) and `ACTOR_LOGIN` (a GitHub login string,
GitHub-controlled, not free text) — neither is attacker-shaped free text. The issue **body** and
**title** content is read exclusively from inside Python (`scripts/gh/gh_adapter.py`, via `gh api`
JSON responses), never passed through a shell interpolation point at all. **Mechanism that prevents the
injection: the issue body/title never crosses into a `run:` shell string — it is fetched and parsed
entirely inside Python via the GitHub API client, which treats it as inert string data (regex match
against `QA_SIGNOFF_MARKER_RE` / `QA_DEVIATION_MARKER_RE` in `scripts/gh/issue_body.py`), never
`eval`'d, never passed to `subprocess` with `shell=True`.** Verified: `grep -rn "shell=True\|os.system"

required pattern (avoidance, not just escaping).**

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Forge a QA sign-off by typing the marker in the issue _body_          | Unit test `scripts/gh/tests/test_guard_qa_signoff.py` covers exactly this: a body-only marker is never read as a sign-off — `_qa_signoff_comment`/`_deviation_comment` only ever scan `comments`, never `issue.body`. Confirmed by reading `guard_qa_signoff.py` L40-67: no code path reads `issue.body` for either marker.                                                                          | **PASS** (control holds)               |
| 2   | Close a `security` ticket using a comment from a non-security member  | `scripts/gh/tests/test_guard_security.py` — the guard's `close` mode requires `author_has_write_access` on the closing comment (same separation-of-duties pattern as QA guard); a comment from an account without repo write access is rejected.                                                                                                                                                     | **PASS**                               |
| 3   | Supply an a11y link pointing at an external site                      | `scripts/gh/tests/test_guard_a11y.py` — guard validates the run-link is a `github.com/<this-repo>/actions/runs/...` URL, not an arbitrary external host.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **PASS**                               |
| 4   | Trigger the guard with the credential revoked (fail-closed)           | `test_run_guard.py` / `test_guard_qa_signoff.py` `write_access_lookup_failed=True` path: verified above (`guard_qa_signoff.py` L85-95) returns `allow=False, fail_closed=True` on API error rather than an implicit pass.                                                                                                                                                                            | **PASS** (fail-closed, not fail-open)  |
| 5   | Attempt to have a workflow print the token to the log                 | `grep -n "print(\|logging\." scripts/gh/*.py` (done above, §5 method): no line prints `PROJECTS_PAT`, `GH_BRANCH_PROTECTION_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`; the only `print()` calls emit guard decisions/reasons (`GOV-006 ...`), never secret values; no workflow step echoes an env dump or uses `set -x` around a secret-bearing step.                                                                 | **PASS**                               |
| 6   | Script-injection via issue title/body containing shell metacharacters | Covered in §5 above (static grep + code-path confirmation).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **PASS**                               |
| 7   | Disable a workflow and confirm the drift job notices                  | **Not executed this session** — `governance-drift.yml`'s `check_branch_protection_drift.py` checks branch-protection _settings_ drift, not workflow-file presence/enabled-state directly; whether a _disabled_ required-check workflow is itself caught is a distinct property from what GOV-005 as currently scoped verifies. This is flagged as **Finding F-1** below rather than assumed to pass. |
| 8   | Real close→reopen race timing (end-to-end)                            | **Not re-executed** — ADR-0017 Q3 already performed this exact probe on a live scratch repo (`basiltt/cv-spike-gov-projects`) with verbatim evidence (issue #2, close→reopen in single-digit seconds, well under the 60s threshold) and that evidence is reused here as still applicable (the reopen logic exercised by the unit tests above is unchanged since that probe).                         | **PASS (evidence reused, not re-run)** |

| F-1 | P2 (Low) | Abuse case #7 ("disable a workflow, confirm drift job notices") is not demonstrably covered: `governance-drift.yml`'s drift check (`check_branch_protection_drift.py`) verifies branch-protection _rule_ settings against `.github/branch-protection.json`, but required-check _workflow files being deleted/disabled_ is a different failure mode (a required check with no workflow to satisfy it just perpetually fails/blocks merges — which is fail-closed, not a silent gap — so the practical risk is low, but the ticket's own abuse-case list names it explicitly and it is not proven here). | Filed as a follow-up (not P0/P1, does not block E01 Done): extend `check_required_check_reconciliation.py` (already run in both `governance.yml` and `governance-drift.yml`) to assert every required-check name in `.github/branch-protection.json` maps to an _enabled_ workflow file, not just a name string. |
| F-2 | P2 (Low) | `scripts/requirements-ci.txt` (installed by `governance.yml` L33) is version-pinned with `==` but has no `--hash` entries, so `pip install` cannot verify package artifact integrity, only version — see §2 for the full analysis and why this does not raise the audit to FAIL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Accepted with follow-up: generate a hashed lockfile (`pip-compile --generate-hashes` or `hashin`) for `scripts/requirements-ci.txt` and switch to `pip install --require-hashes`, tracked as a new infra-devops chore ticket (own small PR, per multi-agent file-ownership rule — not done inline here).         |

## 8. Break-glass / fail-closed availability check

`CONTRIBUTING.md` "Branch protection break-glass runbook" documents: who may invoke it (`@basiltt` or an
explicit written delegate), the required tracking-issue comment before acting, that the automated apply
script is never used for the bypass (manual `gh api`/UI only), mandatory immediate restoration, and that
`governance-drift` independently detects and pages on any un-restored setting regardless of step 4. This
satisfies the ticket's requirement that fail-closed behaviour cannot deadlock delivery indefinitely: a
named, audited manual override exists. **PASS.**

## 9. Observability / detection-path check (per E01-X01 predictions)

| Secrets committed                  | `gitleaks` (SR-142, E03-owned `sast`/`secrets-scan` job)                                                                                 | Not re-verified here (E03 scope)                      |

| Token echoed to logs               | Redaction is structural (secrets never touch a `print`/log call — see §6 case 5), not filter-based                                       | Yes, by construction                                  |

## 10. Follow-ups filed

- F-1 above (required-check-workflow-enabled reconciliation) — recommend filing as an E01-Q02-scoped
  Task; not filed as a new GitHub issue in this PR to keep the diff to the review itself, per the
  ticket's small-PR guidance — the orchestrator/owner can file it directly from this report.
- F-2 above (hashed lockfile for `scripts/requirements-ci.txt`) — recommend filing as an
  infra-devops-scoped chore Task; not fixed inline here for the same small-PR/file-ownership reason.
- Semgrep rule for the `${{ github.event.*.body/title }}` interpolation pattern, to be added to E03's
  `sast` job — **recommended as a follow-up per the ticket's own Technical notes**, not built here (out
  of scope: E03 owns `sast`).
- No test-revoked credential was actually revoked during this review (the abuse cases relying on live
  credential revocation were verified via the existing `write_access_lookup_failed` unit-test path
  instead, per the deviation note in §0) — so there is nothing to restore/confirm-restored this session.
