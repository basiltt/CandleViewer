# 31 - Sprint Plan (S01-S26)

Date: 2026-09-15 | Owner: basiltt | Status: **operational plan derived from `30-release-roadmap.md` (locked) and `backlog/all-tickets.json` (50 epic files, 1327 child tickets)**
Companions: `30-release-roadmap.md` (train sequencing, epic register, dependency graph), `02-definition-of-ready-done.md` (gates every ticket below must pass), `backlog/_reconciliation-report.md` (validator output), `32-risk-register.md`, `33-raci.md`, `07-release-and-prr.md` (PRR & Live gate).

Scope (inherited, unchanged): **web app only** - React + TypeScript + custom WebGL chart engine, Electron desktop shell; owner/admin functions are RBAC-gated routes **inside** the web app; **no Android**, **no separate admin app**; **Bybit v5 USDT linear perpetuals only**.

> **What this document is.** `30-release-roadmap.md` decides *which train* each epic rides and *may not be changed here*. This document decides *which tickets are in which sprint*, who has capacity for them, what must be demoed, and how to re-plan when reality disagrees. Where the two disagree, the roadmap wins on sequencing and dates; this document wins on ticket-level allocation.

## 1. How to read this plan

| Constant | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Sprint length | 2 weeks, Mon -> Fri of week 2 | `00-planning-brief.md` |
| S01 start / S26 end | **2026-09-28** -> **2027-09-24** | roadmap 1.1 |
| Engineering capacity | **90 pts/sprint** (S07 = 45, holidays) | roadmap 1.1 |
| Engineering pool | BE 40 / FE 40 / QA 6 / DevSecOps 2 / Security 2 pts | `01-sdlc-and-branching.md` 11.3 |
| Separate discipline pools | Design ~60, QA ~45, Security ~20 pts/sprint | section 2.2 |
| Estimation scale | Fibonacci 1-2-3-5-8; >8 must split | DoR |
| Design-ahead rule | design Done **>=2 sprints** before its FE story enters a sprint | DoR, roadmap 11.3 rule 1 |
| Tickets planned here | **1327** child tickets under **50** epic files | `backlog/all-tickets.json` |
| Points planned here | eng **1986** / design **918** / QA **802** / security **356** = **4062** total | backlog rollup |
| Engineering capacity over 26 sprints | **2295** pts; planned **1986** (**87%**) | section 2.3 |

### 1.1 Ticket key grammar

Every child ticket key is `E<nn>-<D><nn>` where the discipline letter routes it to a pool and a board swimlane:

| Letter | Kind | Pool | Counts against the 90-pt engineering capacity? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `S` | Story | Engineering | **Yes** |
| `T` | Task | Engineering | **Yes** |
| `K` | Spike | Engineering | **Yes** |
| `C` | Chore | Engineering | **Yes** |
| `D` | Design task | Design org | No - separate pool, runs 2 sprints ahead |
| `Q` | QA/test task | QA/SDET | No - separate pool |
| `X` | Security task | Security engineer | No - separate pool |

This split is the single most important thing to understand about the tables below: **a sprint at 90/90 engineering points can still be over-committed** if its QA or design column exceeds that pool. S13 and S19 are exactly this failure mode.

---

## 2. Capacity model

### 2.1 Engineering (the 90-pt line)

The 90 pts/sprint is the **engineering** number from `01-sdlc-and-branching.md` 11.3 and decomposes as BE 40 / FE 40 / QA 6 / DevSecOps 2 / Security 2. The QA, DevSecOps and Security slivers inside that 90 are for *engineering work done by those roles* (e.g. a DevSecOps pipeline task), not for the QA/design/security ticket pools below.

### 2.2 The other three pools

The org described in `00-planning-brief.md` has a large design organisation, 2 QA/SDET, 1 DevSecOps and 1 Security engineer. Their ticket output is tracked in the `D`/`Q`/`X` columns and sized as:

| Pool | Assumed steady-state capacity | Basis | Sprints that exceed it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Design | ~60 pts/sprint | large design org (CDO, UX research, product designers, DS team, motion, a11y) | S01, S02, S04, S05, S15, S23 |
| QA / SDET | ~45 pts/sprint | 2 QA/SDET at ~22 pts each | S04, S08, S09, S12, S13, S18, S19 |
| Security | ~20 pts/sprint | 1 Security engineer + DevSecOps overlap | S04, S15, S19 |

> **These capacities are assumptions, not measurements.** They are the first thing to recalibrate after S02 and S04 (section 31.2). The `Flag` column in every sprint table below is computed against them.

### 2.3 Master capacity table (all 26 sprints)

| Sprint | Dates | Train | Eng | Cap | Head | Design | QA | Sec | Total | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| | | **Total** | **1963** | **2295** | **+332** | **918** | **802** | **353** | **4036** | |

Unscheduled (`Backlog`, section 32.2): **4** tickets, 8 pts - not in any row above.

**Three structural observations, all of which drive section 31:**

1. **Engineering is 86% loaded across the horizon (1963 of 2295 pts incl. 5 upstream-coordination pts; post-adoption re-plan 2026-09-24).** That is not free slack - it is the roadmap 3.1 named reserves (90 pen-test remediation + 140 defect/polish) plus the per-train buffer. Treat the apparent headroom as already spoken for.
2. **The load is violently uneven.** S26 carries 5 eng pts; S01–S06 and S08–S09 sit at the cap. Sprints sitting at or within 1 pt of the cap have zero room for carry-in, so any spill immediately over-commits them.
3. **QA is the real constraint, not engineering.** QA exceeds its pool in 7 sprints, peaking at 113 pts in S19 - 2.5x capacity. Engineering exceeds its cap only in S07 (+2, holiday; pre-accepted) after the 2026-09-24 post-adoption re-plan.

# R0 - Foundations

| | |
|---|---|
| Sprints | S01-S04 |
| Dates | 2026-09-28 -> 2026-11-20 |
| Version at cut | `0.1.0` |
| Deploys to | dev continuous, staging smoke only |
| Gate | PRR-lite |
| Eng pts in backlog | 355 of 360 capacity (99%) |
| All-discipline pts | 796 |

Nothing in R0 is user-visible. Its entire job is to make every later sprint *possible*: a governed repo, a building monorepo, a deploying pipeline, a measured engine decision, a wired data tier, a design system, an ingestion skeleton and working auth. The two spikes (E06 engine, E07 storage) are the highest-information work in the whole plan - they either confirm the architecture or invalidate a year of estimates.

---

## 3. S01 - 2026-09-28 -> 2026-10-09 (R0)

### 3.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Make the repo governable before any feature code exists.** Ratify `CONSTITUTION.md`, enforce `CODEOWNERS` over every path, and prove a 2-approval PR gate is unbypassable (E01).
- Stand up the monorepo skeleton and toolchain so every later epic has a place to land (E02).
- Open the CI spine: lint/typecheck/unit on every PR, merge queue configured (E03).
- Start the **chart-engine spike** on day 1 - it is the longest pole in the plan and its go/no-go is 2026-10-23 (E06).
- **Design is over pool: 63 pts vs 60 (+3).**

### 3.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

| Discipline | Planned | Capacity | Headroom | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering (S/T/K/C) | 90 | 90 | +0 | ok |
| Design (D) | 63 | 60 | -3 | **OVER** |
| QA (Q) | 1 | 45 | +44 | ok |
| Security (X) | 8 | 20 | +12 | ok |
| **Total** | **162** | **215** | **+53** | |

### 3.3 Epic mix

| Epic | Title | Lane | Pts | Tickets |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **E02** | Monorepo scaffold & toolchain | Platform & DevSecOps | 35 | 14 |
| **E03** | CI/CD pipeline & environments | Platform & DevSecOps | 27 | 9 |
| **E08** | Bybit adapter & ingestion skeleton | Data & Feeds (BE-Feeds) | 27 | 8 |
| **E09** | Auth, sessions, 2FA & RBAC | Accounts & Security (BE-Sec) | 24 | 7 |
| **E01** | Governance & repo constitution: make CandleViewer governable from commit #1 | Governance & Docs | 19 | 12 |
| **E05** | Design system v0 - tokens, primitives, Storybook | Design System | 9 | 3 |
| **E06** | Chart-engine spike & ADR (WebGL2 feasibility, Electron vs Tauri) | Chart Engine (FE-Engine) | 8 | 5 |
| **E04** | Observability baseline: structured logs, metrics, health, dashboards, alerting | Platform & DevSecOps | 6 | 2 |
| **E12** | Bar builders & series rendering (time/tick/volume/range/renko) | Data & Feeds (BE-Feeds) | 3 | 1 |
| **E07** | Storage spike & data-tier wiring (QuestDB / Parquet+DuckDB / Postgres) | Data & Feeds (BE-Feeds) | 2 | 1 |
| **E10** | App shell, routing & Electron wrapper | App & Charting UI (FE-App) | 2 | 1 |


**Statechart lane:** none this sprint.

### 3.6 QA & security items

**Continuous track bars active this sprint** (roadmap 10.1):

- sec: STRIDE R0 epics (s01, S01-S04)
- sec: SAST/SCA/secrets continuous (s02, S01-S26)
- qa: Test framework build-out (q01, S01-S04)

**QA tickets (1 pts, 1 tickets):**

| Key | Title | Est | blocked_by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `E01-Q01` | Author and execute the governance conformance test plan and exploratory charter | 1 | `E01-T01`, `E01-T08` |

**Security tickets (8 pts, 4 tickets):**

| Key | Title | Est | blocked_by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `E01-X01` | STRIDE threat model for the repository, CI and board administration surface | 2 |  |
| `E02-X01` | Security: STRIDE threat model for the monorepo supply chain and local dev stack | 2 | `E02-T01` |

| `E06-X01` | STRIDE model of the engine and desktop-shell boundary; hardening checklist | 1 | `E01` |

### 3.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **E06 engine spike is the schedule's longest pole.** If WebGL text-LOD cannot hit the footprint density target, every R1+ frontend estimate is invalid. Fallback to Lightweight Charts is pre-decided in ADR-0006.
- E01 -> E02 -> E03 is a strict serial root: any governance slip pushes the whole plan right.
- Design track D-S01 must produce DS v0 tokens this sprint or S03's UI work has no foundation (design-ahead rule).

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

| Blocker | Where it lives | Dependents in S01 |
|---|---|---|
| `E02` | epic E02 (whole epic must be Done) | 7 |
| `E01` | epic E01 (whole epic must be Done) | 3 |
| `E03` | epic E03 (whole epic must be Done) | 2 |

### 3.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** A PR that lacks 2 approvals or a code-owner is demonstrably unmergeable; `make bootstrap` produces a working dev env; CI runs green on a trivial PR.

**Exit expectation:** R0 exit criterion #1 evidenced. Engine spike has a measured first data point.

### 3.9 Burn-up - R0 train

| Sprint | Eng pts this sprint | Cumulative R0 | R0 total | Remaining | % complete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S01 **<- this sprint** | 90 | 90 | 355 | 265 | 25% |
| S02 | 90 | 180 | 355 | 175 | 51% |
| S03 | 87 | 267 | 355 | 88 | 75% |
| S04 | 88 | 355 | 355 | 0 | 100% |

## 4. S02 - 2026-10-12 -> 2026-10-23 (R0)

### 4.1 Sprint goal(s)

- Finish the monorepo scaffold: workspaces, shared tsconfig/ruff/mypy, dependency policy, reproducible dev container (E02).
- **Engine spike go/no-go (2026-10-23)** - WebGL text-LOD and Electron-vs-Tauri measurements land as ADR-0006 (E06).
- Storage spike: prove QuestDB hot-path write rates and Parquet/DuckDB cold reads against a recorded Bybit fixture (E07).
- Observability baseline: structured logs, Prometheus scrape, first Grafana board (E04).
- **Design is over pool: 98 pts vs 60 (+38).**

### 4.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **Go/no-go gate 2026-10-23 on E06.** Architect + Owner decision required; a 'no-go' triggers an immediate re-plan of R1.
- E07 storage spike may show QuestDB write rates below the ingestion budget - contingency is a partitioning-strategy change, not a storage swap.
- E02 at 25 pts is the sprint's largest item; scaffold churn blocks every other lane.

### 4.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Monorepo builds all packages from a cold clone; engine spike demo shows measured FPS at target footprint density; QuestDB ingest benchmark shown live.

**Exit expectation:** **ADR-0006 merged with the go/no-go decision recorded.**

## 5. S03 - 2026-10-26 -> 2026-11-06 (R0)

### 5.1 Sprint goal(s)

- Complete CI/CD to staging: build, container scan, deploy pipeline, environment separation (E03).
- Wire the data tier for real - QuestDB + Parquet + Postgres schemas migrated from `21-database-schema.md` (E07).
- Bring up the app shell and Electron wrapper on design-system v0 primitives (E10).
- Land the observability baseline's alerting rules and the first SLO dashboard (E04).

### 5.5 Design-track deliverables due

**Design sprint D-S03** (roadmap 1.2) produces: Chart surface, time/price axes, crosshair, chart toolbar, indicator UI

> Consumed by engineering sprint **S05** (+2 sprints). Every one of these must reach Status=Done with CDO sign-off **inside this sprint**, or the S05 frontend stories fail DoR and cannot be pulled.

### 5.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- E03 CI/CD must reach staging this sprint or the R0 exit criterion on deployability fails.
- Data-tier migrations are irreversible in staging; rehearse rollback.

### 5.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** A commit flows to staging through the pipeline unattended; Grafana shows live ingestion metrics; the app shell renders an RBAC-gated route.

**Exit expectation:** Staging deployment is repeatable and rollback is demonstrated.

## 6. S04 - 2026-11-09 -> 2026-11-20 (R0)

### 6.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Close R0.** Design-system v0 ships its full primitive set and Storybook (E05) - the biggest single-epic sprint load in the train at 47 pts.
- App shell routing, RBAC-gated route guards and the Electron packaging path complete (E10).
- First engine-core foundations land against the ratified ADR (E11).
- Recorder groundwork starts so the >=2-sprint recording rule (roadmap 11.3 rule 4) can be met by R2 (E16).
- **QA is over pool: 65 pts vs 45 (+20).**
- **Design is over pool: 81 pts vs 60 (+21).**
- **Security is over pool: 26 pts vs 20 (+6).**

### 6.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **R0 exit gate 2026-11-20.** All four exit criteria must have evidence links or R1 cannot open.
- E05 at 47 pts is the heaviest single-epic sprint load in R0 - a design-system slip cascades to every FE lane.
- Recorder (E16) must begin recording now: roadmap 11.3 rule 4 requires >=2 sprints of history before any view that depends on it ships.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

| Blocker | Where it lives | Dependents in S04 |
|---|---|---|
| `E05` | epic E05 (whole epic must be Done) | 5 |
| `E09-S03` | Sprint 03 | 4 |
| `E10-D04` | Sprint 02 | 4 |
| `E10-T04` | Sprint 03 | 4 |
| `E07-T05` | Sprint 03 | 3 |
| `E08-S05` | Sprint 03 | 3 |
| `E10-T02` | Sprint 03 | 3 |
| `E15-D02` | Sprint 03 | 3 |
| `E05-D02` | Sprint 02 | 2 |

| `E08-Q01` | Sprint 03 | 2 |
| `E09-S05` | Sprint 03 | 2 |
| _... 52 more_ | | |

### 6.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Storybook published with the full DS v0 primitive set; Electron app launches and navigates; recorder is writing ticks for the seed symbol list.

**Exit expectation:** **R0 gate (PRR-lite) 2026-11-20 - `0.1.0` tagged.** All four R0 exit criteria evidenced.

### 6.9 Burn-up - R0 train

| Sprint | Eng pts this sprint | Cumulative R0 | R0 total | Remaining | % complete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S01 | 90 | 90 | 355 | 265 | 25% |
| S02 | 90 | 180 | 355 | 175 | 51% |
| S03 | 87 | 267 | 355 | 88 | 75% |

# R1 - Charting alpha

| | |
|---|---|
| Sprints | S05-S09 |
| Dates | 2026-11-23 -> 2027-01-29 |
| Version at cut | `0.2.0` |
| Deploys to | staging (demo) |
| Gate | PRR |
| Eng pts in backlog | 407 of 405 capacity (100%) |
| All-discipline pts | 831 |

R1 turns the engine spike into a real chart: scene graph, axes, interaction, LOD, bar builders across five bar types, an indicator framework, drawing tools, layouts, the recorder and the market-data WS protocol. This is the train where the frontend becomes a product rather than a prototype, and where the critical path `E11 -> E12` runs at full load.

---

## 7. S05 - 2026-11-23 -> 2026-12-04 (R1)

### 7.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Open R1 on the critical path.** Engine core scene graph, camera, axes and the shared tick-precise time/price transform (E11).
- Market-data WS protocol and binary framing - the contract every later pane consumes (E17).
- Recorder continues so symbol history accumulates ahead of R2 (E16).
- **Design is over pool: 80 pts vs 60 (+20).**

### 7.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

| Discipline | Planned | Capacity | Headroom | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering (S/T/K/C) | 90 | 90 | +0 | ok |
| Design (D) | 80 | 60 | -20 | **OVER** |
| QA (Q) | 0 | 45 | +45 | ok |
| Security (X) | 9 | 20 | +11 | ok |

### 7.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **E11 engine core is on the critical path** (`E02->E06->E11->E12->E18->E26->E38->E44->E46->GA`). Staffed with the chart-engine lead + 2 FE; the benchmark harness must be in CI from day 1 so regressions surface same-day.
- E17 WS protocol is an interface-first contract: it must merge before any consumer story enters a sprint (DoR).

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

### 7.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** A live candlestick chart panning and zooming at budget FPS on real Bybit WS data, end to end.

**Exit expectation:** Engine benchmark harness reporting in CI on every PR.

## 8. S06 - 2026-12-07 -> 2026-12-18 (R1)

### 8.1 Sprint goal(s)

- Finish the WS protocol: subscription lifecycle, backpressure, reconnect/resume semantics (E17).
- Engine core interaction layer - crosshair, pan/zoom, LOD switching at target FPS (E11).
- Recorder retention and disk-budget enforcement (E16).
- **Planned over capacity: 101 eng pts vs 90 (+11).** Roadmap 13 forbids moving dates; resolve at sprint planning per section 31, never mid-sprint.

### 8.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- E17 at 38 pts plus E11 at 36 pts loads both the platform and engine leads simultaneously - watch for review bottlenecks.
- Recorder disk-budget enforcement can silently drop data if misconfigured; needs a chaos test, not just a unit test.
- Holiday sprint S07 follows: nothing started here should require S07 completion.

### 8.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** WS reconnect/resume demonstrated by killing the feed mid-stream; recorder retention prunes to budget on demand.

**Exit expectation:** Chaos test for WS disconnect passes.

## 9. S07 - 2026-12-21 -> 2027-01-01 (R1)

### 9.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Holiday sprint - 45 pts capacity, plan accordingly.** Do not start new critical-path work.
- Indicators framework lands its evaluation core and first indicator set (E13).
- Engine core hardening and benchmark-harness stabilisation (E11).
- **Planned over capacity: 61 eng pts vs 45 (+16).** Roadmap 13 forbids moving dates; resolve at sprint planning per section 31, never mid-sprint.

### 9.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

| Discipline | Planned | Capacity | Headroom | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering (S/T/K/C) | 47 | 45 | -2 | **OVER** |
| Design (D) | 18 | 60 | +42 | ok |
| QA (Q) | 32 | 45 | +13 | ok |
| Security (X) | 9 | 20 | +11 | ok |
| **Total** | **106** | **170** | **+64** | |

### 9.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **45-pt capacity.** Any item carried in at full estimate will slip. The 45-pt shortfall is absorbed by the train buffer, never by weakening R1 exit criteria.
- Design sprint D-S07 is also reduced - CVD/detector designs may arrive thin; verify before S09 planning.

## 10. S08 - 2027-01-04 -> 2027-01-15 (R1)

### 10.1 Sprint goal(s)

- Recorder, retention and disk budget complete - the heaviest sprint for E16 (47 pts, half the epic).
- Indicator v1 set finishes: overlays, panes, parameter UI (E13).
- Replay engine and footprint groundwork begin one train early (E26, E18).
- **QA is over pool: 60 pts vs 45 (+15).**

### 10.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

### 10.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- E16 at 51 pts is the sprint's dominant load and it gates R2's replay and footprint work.
- QA load jumps to 38 pts (golden-fixture corpus) - QA is the constraint this sprint, not engineering.
- DAST quarterly scans begin (s06); first-run findings often spike triage load.

### 10.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Full v1 indicator set on a live chart; replay scrubbing a recorded session; footprint first pixels.

**Exit expectation:** Golden-fixture corpus published and consumed by contract tests.

## 11. S09 - 2027-01-18 -> 2027-01-29 (R1)

### 11.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Close R1 and cut `0.2.0`.** Engine core final acceptance against the FPS budgets in `06-performance-and-load-standard.md` (E11).
- Deep-Stats and footprint scaffolding land so R2 opens at full speed (E20, E18).
- Light engineering sprint by design (3 pts) - the load is design (31) and QA (8): R1 exit evidence, not new scope.
- **QA is over pool: 50 pts vs 45 (+5).**

### 11.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

### 11.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **R1 exit gate 2027-01-29 + PRR.** Engineering is only 3 pts - the risk is that exit *evidence* (benchmarks, E2E, a11y) is treated as slack and slips.
- Load & soak campaigns open (q07, running to S20). Early results may invalidate R2 render budgets.
- Design load is 31 pts against a 3-pt eng load: confirm the design org is actually ahead, not just busy.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

# R2 - Order-flow beta

| | |
|---|---|
| Sprints | S10-S13 |
| Dates | 2027-02-01 -> 2027-03-26 |
| Version at cut | `0.3.0` |
| Deploys to | staging (demo) |
| Gate | PRR |
| Eng pts in backlog | 357 of 360 capacity (99%) |
| All-discipline pts | 681 |

R2 is the order-flow differentiator: footprint, profiles, Deep-Stats rows, DOM ladder and liquidity heatmap, big trades, CVD, derivatives metrics, estimated detectors and the replay engine. Every one of these renders through the engine built in R1, so the render hot path is the shared surface that decides whether R2 fits.

---

## 12. S10 - 2027-02-01 -> 2027-02-12 (R2)

### 12.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Open R2.** Footprint is scheduled first because it is the heaviest render path and sets R2's ceiling (E18).
- DOM ladder and liquidity heatmap begin on the engine core (E21).
- CVD/delta panes and derivatives metrics start their backend aggregations (E23, E24).

### 12.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

| Discipline | Planned | Capacity | Headroom | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering (S/T/K/C) | 89 | 90 | +1 | ok |
| Design (D) | 23 | 60 | +37 | ok |
| QA (Q) | 2 | 45 | +43 | ok |
| Security (X) | 16 | 20 | +4 | ok |
| **Total** | **130** | **215** | **+85** | |

### 12.3 Epic mix

| Epic | Title | Lane | Pts | Tickets |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **E18** | Footprint: cell aggregation, imbalance detection and cell rendering | Order Flow (BE-Flow + FE-Engine) | 39 | 13 |
| **E26** | Replay engine & scrubbing | Data & Feeds (BE-Feeds) | 22 | 8 |
| **E21** | DOM ladder & liquidity heatmap | Order Flow (BE-Flow + FE-Engine) | 18 | 5 |
| **E19** | Volume / delta / TPO profiles | Order Flow (BE-Flow + FE-Engine) | 14 | 5 |
| **E23** | CVD & delta panes: cumulative delta, anchors, display modes and divergence | Order Flow (BE-Flow + FE-Engine) | 12 | 5 |
| **E25** | Detectors: tape speed, imbalance, regime, iceberg/stop-run (estimated) | Order Flow (BE-Flow + FE-Engine) | 10 | 4 |
| **E24** | Derivatives metrics: open interest, funding, liquidations and basis | Order Flow (BE-Flow + FE-Engine) | 7 | 3 |

### 12.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **E18 footprint sets the ceiling for all of R2.** If its render budget is missed, the descoping ladder starts at E19 TPO/composite profiles.
- Security load spikes to 13 pts (STRIDE R2 epics) - book the Security engineer early.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

| Blocker | Where it lives | Dependents in S10 |
|---|---|---|

### 12.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Footprint cells rendering at production density; DOM ladder with live heatmap; CVD pane tracking the tape.

**Exit expectation:** Order-flow correctness suite (q05) reporting.

### 13.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **First sprint at the capacity line (89/90).** Footprint and DOM heatmap run in parallel on separate render passes (E18 17, E21 24).
- Deep-Stats rows and detectors build on the now-live order-flow aggregates (E20, E25).
- Replay engine continues its three-sprint run (E26).

### 13.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- E18 and E21 both write to the engine render path; enforce the lane separation or expect merge conflicts in the hot path.
- E26 replay is started one train early precisely because R3 depends on it - protect it from being raided for R2 scope.

## 14. S12 - 2027-03-01 -> 2027-03-12 (R2)

### 14.1 Sprint goal(s)

- DOM ladder + heatmap hits peak load (E21) - the render-budget risk sprint of R2.
- Deep-Stats rows complete (E20); detectors reach their *(estimated)* badge UX (E25).
- OMS core and accounts work start early to de-risk R3's opening (E29, E27).
- **QA is over pool: 55 pts vs 45 (+10).**

### 14.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- E21 at 50 pts on the heatmap render path, concurrent with E20 at 33 - the peak engine-contention sprint of R2.
- E27/E29 start early inside R2; they must not consume R2 buffer meant for footprint/heatmap overruns.
- QA jumps to 42 pts (order-flow correctness suite) - the QA pool, not eng, is the binding constraint.

## 15. S13 - 2027-03-15 -> 2027-03-26 (R2)

### 15.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Close R2 and cut `0.3.0`.** Replay engine completes (E26) - the deterministic test harness R3 depends on.
- Derivatives metrics and CVD panes finish (E24 40, E23 30); detectors land (E25 31).
- **QA is over pool: 83 pts vs 45 (+38).**

### 15.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **QA at 72 pts and design at 56 pts** - both far above steady state. This is an R2-exit evidence pile-up.
- **10 DESIGN-AHEAD errors land here**: E24-S01/S03/S05/S08 consume E24-D05 (same sprint) and E25-S01..S06 consume E25-D07 (one sprint prior). Both violate the >=2-sprint rule - needs an Architect/CDO waiver or a re-sequence before S13 opens.
- **R2 exit gate 2027-03-26 + PRR.**

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

### 15.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** R2 acceptance: replay a recorded session with footprint, profiles, heatmap, CVD, derivatives and detectors all active and deterministic.

**Exit expectation:** **R2 gate (PRR) 2027-03-26 - `0.3.0` tagged, deployed to staging (demo).**

# R3 - Trading on demo

| | |
|---|---|
| Sprints | S14-S19 |
| Dates | 2027-03-29 -> 2027-06-18 |
| Version at cut | `0.4.0` |
| Deploys to | staging (demo), 7-day soak |
| Gate | PRR + demo-trading soak gate |
| Eng pts in backlog | 488 of 540 capacity (90%) |
| All-discipline pts | 1070 |

R3 is the largest train in the plan: accounts and the key vault, per-account profiles, the OMS, order ticket, chart and DOM trading, brackets with the native-SL invariant, emulated algos, trade-group fan-out, the rule engine and both editors, paper trading, risk caps and kill-switch, alerts, journal and admin screens. Safety ordering (roadmap 11.3 rule 2) governs sequencing throughout: no order-placing UI ships before the vault, risk caps and native SL are Done.

---

## 16. S14 - 2027-03-29 -> 2027-04-09 (R3)

### 16.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Open R3 on the two safety-critical roots.** Accounts + API-key vault (E27) and OMS core state machine (E29) start day 1.
- Rule-engine IR and compiler begin (E35); rule form editor starts behind it (E36).
- Deliberately light eng load (34 pts) against a heavy design load (58 pts) - R3's UI surface is being designed ahead.

### 16.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

| Discipline | Planned | Capacity | Headroom | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering (S/T/K/C) | 88 | 90 | +2 | ok |
| Design (D) | 58 | 60 | +2 | ok |
| QA (Q) | 6 | 45 | +39 | ok |

### 16.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **E27 and E29 are the roots of all of R3.** Both start day 1; neither has slack.
- Design load is 58 pts vs 34 eng - R3's UI is being designed two sprints ahead, as required. If design slips here, S16-S17 FE work is blocked by DoR.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

| Blocker | Where it lives | Dependents in S14 |
|---|---|---|
| `E27` | epic E27 (whole epic must be Done) | 8 |

| _... 3 more_ | | |

### 16.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** An API key is added, envelope-encrypted, verified withdrawal-OFF, and an order state machine transitions through a full lifecycle in simulation.

**Exit expectation:** Key vault threat model signed off by the Security engineer.

## 17. S15 - 2027-04-12 -> 2027-04-23 (R3)

### 17.1 Sprint goal(s)

- Key vault completes with envelope encryption and the **withdrawal-permission-OFF check** (E27).
- Risk caps, lockouts and kill-switch (E39) land *before* any order-placing UI, per roadmap 11.3 rule 2.
- Brackets and the native-SL invariant begin (E32); rule IR runtime continues (E35).
- **Design is over pool: 66 pts vs 60 (+6).**
- **Security is over pool: 21 pts vs 20 (+1).**

### 17.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **Safety ordering is non-negotiable**: E39 risk caps + kill-switch and E27 key vault must be Done before any order-placing UI enters a sprint (roadmap 11.3 rule 2).
- Security load spikes to 21 pts; design to 66 pts (the highest of the plan). Both are above their pool's steady state.
- Safety-invariant QA suite (q06) opens and runs to S18 - it is the evidence base for the Live gate.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

| Blocker | Where it lives | Dependents in S15 |
|---|---|---|
| `E29` | epic E29 (whole epic must be Done) | 8 |
| `E27-D06` | Sprint 13 | 5 |
| `E27-T03` | Sprint 14 | 5 |
| `E27-T04` | Sprint 14 | 4 |
| `E27-T02` | Sprint 14 | 3 |
| `E27-X01` | Sprint 14 | 3 |
| `E27` | epic E27 (whole epic must be Done) | 3 |
| `E29-T05` | Sprint 14 | 3 |
| `E29-T04` | Sprint 14 | 3 |
| `E30-D03` | Sprint 14 | 3 |
| `E32-D02` | Sprint 14 | 3 |
| `E35-T04` | Sprint 14 | 3 |
| _... 29 more_ | | |

### 17.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Kill-switch halts all order flow in <1s; a risk cap blocks an over-sized order; the rule IR compiles and runs a simple rule.

**Exit expectation:** Safety prerequisites (E27, E39) Done - unblocks order-placing UI for S16.

### 17.9 Burn-up - R3 train

| Sprint | Eng pts this sprint | Cumulative R3 | R3 total | Remaining | % complete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S14 | 88 | 88 | 488 | 400 | 18% |
| S15 **<- this sprint** | 89 | 177 | 488 | 311 | 36% |
| S16 | 89 | 266 | 488 | 222 | 55% |

## 18. S16 - 2027-04-26 -> 2027-05-07 (R3)

### 18.1 Sprint goal(s)

- Brackets + native SL invariant (E32, 21 pts this sprint) and risk caps (E39, 20 pts this sprint) advance - the safety floor for all trading UI.
- Per-account profiles and trade groups (E28) and admin screens (E42) reach the halfway mark.
- Order ticket and chart/DOM trading UI can now legally start (their safety prerequisites are Done).

### 18.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

### 18.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- E32 native-SL invariant is on the **never-cut** list. It cannot be descoped to make the sprint fit.
- Four epics >=17 pts run concurrently (E32, E39, E28, E42) against an 89/90 load - one carry-in breaks the sprint.
- E42 admin screens touch auth/RBAC: the security label is **default-on** for DoD regardless of what was applied at creation.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

| Blocker | Where it lives | Dependents in S16 |
|---|---|---|
| `E29` | epic E29 (whole epic must be Done) | 8 |
| `E28-T05` | Sprint 15 | 5 |
| `E28-D06` | Sprint 14 | 3 |
| `E29-T07` | Sprint 15 | 3 |

| `E34-D01` | Sprint 15 | 2 |
| _... 44 more_ | | |

### 18.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** A bracket order places with a **native exchange-side SL** attached, on demo; trade-group profile applied; the admin audit log shows every action.

**Exit expectation:** Native-SL invariant proven by an automated safety-invariant test, not a manual demo.

### 19.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **Roadmap 11.3 rule 5: both rule editors must merge together or not at all.** E36 completes here at 37 pts but E37 does not finish until S18 - the merge is therefore an S18 event; plan the feature flag now.
- 89/90 load with E36, E33, E35 and E37 all active in the rule-engine lane - real contention on `area/rule-engine`.
- E38 paper-trading parity begins; parity gaps discovered late are expensive at the Live gate.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

| Blocker | Where it lives | Dependents in S17 |
|---|---|---|

| _... 45 more_ | | |

### 19.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** A rule authored in the form editor executes against live demo data and fires an alert; an OCO pair cancels correctly.

**Exit expectation:** Paper/live parity report published with first delta measurements.

## 20. S18 - 2027-05-24 -> 2027-06-04 (R3)

### 20.1 Sprint goal(s)

- Emulated algos complete (E33); rule **node-graph editor** reaches feature parity with the form editor (E37).
- Fan-out and rate-limit governor continue (E34); alerts and journal open (E40, E41).
- R4 hardening work starts overlapping (E43) so the pen-test window is not the first security pass.
- **QA is over pool: 46 pts vs 45 (+1).**

### 20.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

| Discipline | Planned | Capacity | Headroom | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering (S/T/K/C) | 88 | 90 | +2 | ok |

### 20.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- 90/90 load, zero headroom, immediately before the R3-exit sprint.
- E33 at 43 pts (emulated algos) is the largest item; the chase algo is descoping-ladder item #5 if the sprint is at risk.
- QA at 46 pts; the chaos catalogue (q08) opens and runs to S23.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

### 20.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Iceberg and TWAP execute on demo; the node-graph editor round-trips a rule authored in the form editor through the same IR.

**Exit expectation:** Both rule editors behind one feature flag, ready to merge together in S19.

### 21.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- E30 (30 pts landing here, 87 across the epic) and E34 (40 pts here, 91 across the epic) both complete in this sprint and both gate R4. Neither can slip without moving the Live train.
- **7-day soak (q09) closes 2027-06-17, one day before the R3 gate** - zero recovery time if the soak surfaces a defect.
- Mitigation to decide at S18 planning: pull E41 advanced analytics (ladder #7) and E40 webhook delivery (ladder #6) into R5.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

### 21.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** **Full R3 walkthrough on demo:** ticket -> fan-out to N accounts -> every child order carries a native SL -> positions manager -> journal entry -> alert.

**Exit expectation:** **R3 gate (PRR + 7-day demo-trading soak) 2027-06-18 - `0.4.0`.** Soak closes 2027-06-17.

# R4 - Live enablement

| | |
|---|---|
| Sprints | S20-S22 |
| Dates | 2027-06-21 -> 2027-07-30 |
| Version at cut | `1.0.0` |
| Deploys to | prod (live) |
| Gate | PRR + **Live-enablement gate** |
| Eng pts in backlog | 154 of 270 capacity (57%) |
| All-discipline pts | 253 |

R4 exists to earn the right to touch real money: pre-pen-test hardening, an independent pen-test with a pre-allocated 90-pt remediation reserve, reconciliation and chaos resilience, and the live-enablement gate that defaults OFF. Code freeze is 2027-07-02.

---

## 22. S20 - 2027-06-21 -> 2027-07-02 (R4)

### 22.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Open R4.** Pre-pen-test hardening sweep and full STRIDE refresh across all ten areas (E43).
- Live-enablement gating and environment separation - the gate defaults **OFF** (E44).
- No new feature scope enters R4. Code freeze for pen-test is 2027-07-02.

### 22.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

| Discipline | Planned | Capacity | Headroom | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering (S/T/K/C) | 87 | 90 | +3 | ok |
| Design (D) | 6 | 60 | +54 | ok |

### 22.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **Code freeze for pen-test is 2027-07-02 (end of this sprint).** Anything not merged does not get pen-tested.
- E43 at 77 pts is the largest single-epic sprint load in the entire plan.
- Pre-pen-test hardening (s07) is a hard-dated bar - the pen-test vendor slot is booked and non-movable.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

### 23.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **Pen-test findings are certain; their content is not.** The 90-pt remediation reserve is deliberately unallocated - resist filling it with feature scope.
- E44 live gating completes here; it is the *only* mechanism that can enable live and it defaults OFF (roadmap 11.3 rule 3).
- Eng load held low (43 pts) on purpose. If the sprint looks 'underloaded' at planning, that is the plan working.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

### 23.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Pen-test findings presented and triaged live; reconciliation detects and reports an injected divergence.

**Exit expectation:** Remediation plan agreed, with Owner sign-off on any accepted risk.

### 24.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **R4 exit = Live-enablement gate 2027-07-30.** This is the highest-consequence gate in the plan.
- Key-permission audit (s10) closes 2027-07-23, a week before the gate - enough margin for one remediation cycle only.
- E45 reconciliation correctness is **never-cut**: a reconciliation bug at the Live gate is a stop-ship.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

| Blocker | Where it lives | Dependents in S22 |
|---|---|---|

### 24.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** **Live-enablement gate walkthrough** - the one controlled exception where a demo touches prod (`07-release-and-prr.md` 6). Chaos suite passes: WS disconnect, exchange 5xx, rate-limit 10018.

**Exit expectation:** **R4 gate + Live-enablement gate 2027-07-30 - `1.0.0` to prod (live).**

# R5 - Hardening / GA

| | |
|---|---|
| Sprints | S23-S26 |
| Dates | 2027-08-02 -> 2027-09-24 |
| Version at cut | `1.1.0` (GA) |
| Deploys to | prod (live) |
| Gate | PRR re-run + GA checklist |
| Eng pts in backlog | 202 of 360 capacity (56%) |
| All-discipline pts | 405 |

R5 is hardening only: performance budget enforcement, WCAG 2.2 AA conformance, chaos catalogue completion, documentation and runbooks, and the defect burn-down / design-QA sweep. No new product scope enters R5 except descoped ladder items explicitly moved here.

---

## 25. S23 - 2027-08-02 -> 2027-08-13 (R5)

### 25.1 Sprint goal(s)

- **Open R5.** Defect burn-down and design-QA sweep begin their four-sprint run (E49).
- Performance hardening against the budgets in `06-performance-and-load-standard.md` (E46).
- Accessibility conformance work (E47) runs on the design track; live ramp verification starts (QA q10).
- **Design is over pool: 66 pts vs 60 (+6).**

### 25.2 Capacity by discipline vs planned points

| Discipline | Planned | Capacity | Headroom | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering (S/T/K/C) | 87 | 90 | +3 | ok |

### 25.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- Live ramp verification (q10) begins - first real-money exposure, tightly bounded.
- E49 defect burn-down (44 pts) is sized from the 140-pt R5 reserve; if R4 spilled, this is where it shows.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

| Blocker | Where it lives | Dependents in S23 |
|---|---|---|
| `E44` | epic E44 (whole epic must be Done) | 3 |

| `E47` | epic E47 (whole epic must be Done) | 1 |

### 25.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Performance budgets met under load; live ramp verification shows controlled, bounded real-money exposure.

**Exit expectation:** Defect burn-down trend published and trending down.

### 25.9 Burn-up - R5 train

## 26. S24 - 2027-08-16 -> 2027-08-27 (R5)

### 26.1 Sprint goal(s)

- Performance hardening continues (E46) - engine FPS, WS fan-out, ingestion soak.
- Defect burn-down continues (E49). Lightest sprint of R5 by design: it is the shock absorber for R4 spillover.

### 26.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- Lightest R5 sprint (41 eng pts) - deliberately reserved as the shock absorber for R4 spillover and live-ramp findings.
- Zero design and zero security points planned. If either discipline has open work, it is unplanned and needs surfacing.

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Engine FPS, WS fan-out and ingestion soak all within budget on production-shaped load.

**Exit expectation:** No demo gate; progress review only.

### 27.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **GA regression + 72h soak starts 2027-09-06 (week 2).** A soak failure here has only one sprint of recovery.
- E48 docs at 30 pts plus E49 at 33 and E46 at 29 - 65 eng pts across three epics closing simultaneously.
- Final security sweep (s11) runs S25-S26; findings at this point are GA-blocking by definition.

**External `blocked_by` entering this sprint** (must be Done before the dependent ticket starts):

### 27.8 Demo & exit expectations

**Sprint Review demo (on staging/demo, never live):** Runbooks exercised by someone who did not write them; GA regression suite green; 72h soak running.

**Exit expectation:** Final security sweep findings triaged to zero GA-blockers.

### 28.7 Risks & dependency watch-list

- **GA cut 2027-09-24.** No scope may be added. Only defect fixes with a named GA-blocking justification.
- E48 must land the runbooks - an un-runbooked production system fails the GA checklist regardless of code quality.
- Unused reserve converts to post-GA backlog, never to an earlier date claim (roadmap 3.1).

# 29. Parallel-work lanes

## 29.1 The lane model

A **lane** is a standing team that owns a set of epics which touch a disjoint set of modules. Two lanes may run in the same sprint without coordination overhead only if their module sets do not intersect. Where they do intersect, the intersection is named explicitly below and needs a written interface-first contract merged *before* both lanes start (DoR: "the interface-first contract is already merged or is itself a prerequisite Task marked `blocked_by`").

| Lane | Owns epics | Primary modules / areas | Typical staffing |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Accounts & Security (BE-Sec)** | E09, E27, E42, E43, E44 | `area/auth-rbac`, `area/accounts-admin`; M2, M13, M18, M19, M21 | 1-2 BE + Security engineer |
| **App & Charting UI (FE-App)** | E10, E13, E14, E15, E30, E31, E36, E37, E41 | `area/charting-ui`, `area/electron-shell`, `area/journal-analytics`; M9 (read), M20 | 2-3 FE |
| **Chart Engine (FE-Engine)** | E06, E11, E46 | `area/chart-engine`; the WebGL render package (no backend modules) | chart-engine lead + 2 FE |
| **Cross-cutting defect & design-QA** | E49 | all | whole team, rotating |
| **Data & Feeds (BE-Feeds)** | E07, E08, E12, E16, E17, E26 | `area/ingestion`, `area/recorder-replay`; M3-M8, M10-M12, M23 | 2 BE |
| **Design System** | E05, E47 | `area/design-system`; `packages/design-system`, Storybook | DS team + a11y specialist |
| **Governance & Docs** | E01, E48 | `area/docs`; repo root, `.github/` | Architect + tech writer (part-time) |
| **OMS & Execution (BE-OMS)** | E28, E29, E32, E33, E34, E38, E39, E45 | `area/oms-execution`, `area/paper-trading`; M14, M16, M17 | 2-3 BE |
| **Order Flow (BE-Flow + FE-Engine)** | E18, E19, E20, E21, E22, E23, E24, E25 | `area/order-flow`; M7, M9 + engine render passes | 2 BE + 1 FE (shared with engine lane) |
| **Platform & DevSecOps** | E02, E03, E04 | `area/backend-platform`, `area/infra-devops`, `area/frontend-platform`; M1, M24 | 1 BE + DevSecOps |
| **Rules & Alerts (BE-Rules)** | E35, E40 | `area/rule-engine`; M15, M22 | 1-2 BE + 1 FE |

Every epic in the register belongs to exactly one lane; no epic is unassigned.

## 29.2 Known lane collisions (the ones that actually bite)

| Sprints | Lanes | Shared surface | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| S10-S12 | Order Flow vs Chart Engine | the engine **render hot path** - E18 footprint and E21 heatmap both add draw passes | Separate render passes with an agreed pass-ordering contract merged in S09. Neither lane edits the other's pass. The benchmark harness gates every PR so a regression is attributed same-day. |
| S12-S13 | Order Flow vs OMS & Accounts | E27/E29 start *inside* R2 while R2 is still finishing | E27/E29 draw from the **R3** budget, not the R2 buffer. They may not take R2 review capacity from E18/E21/E26. |
| S15-S19 | OMS & Execution vs App & Charting UI | E30/E31 order-placing UI calls into E29/E32/E39 | Safety ordering (roadmap 11.3 rule 2) means the BE side is Done first by construction. FE consumes a frozen OpenAPI/WS contract (`22-api-openapi.yaml`, `23-ws-protocol.md`). |
| S17-S18 | Rules & Alerts internal | E35 IR, E36 form editor, E37 node editor all live in `area/rule-engine` | The single IR is the contract (ADR). Both editors merge **together or not at all** (roadmap 11.3 rule 5) - one feature flag covering both. |
| S18-S22 | Accounts & Security vs everyone | E43 hardening touches every area | E43 lands as review + targeted fixes, not refactors. Any fix >8 pts becomes its own ticket in the owning lane. |
| S23-S26 | Cross-cutting vs all | E49 defect burn-down edits any module | Defects are routed to the **owning lane**, not fixed by the finder, unless trivial. E49 is a coordination ticket set, not a parallel team. |

## 29.3 Lane occupancy by sprint

Which lanes are active in each sprint, and at what point load. Figures are **all-discipline totals** (eng + design + QA + security) for the epics that lane owns, so they are deliberately larger than the engineering-only numbers in section 2.3 - this table is about *who is busy*, not about the 90-pt line. A blank cell means the lane has no scheduled work and its people are available to the loaded lanes in the same row.

| Sprint | Plat | Gov | DS | Engine | Feeds | FE-App | Flow | Acct/Sec | OMS | Rules | Defect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S01** | 68 | 19 | 9 | 8 | 32 | 2 |  | 24 |  |  |  |
| **S02** | 46 | 3 | 13 | 2 | 97 | 13 |  | 34 |  |  |  |

| **S11** |  |  |  |  | 5 |  | 129 |  |  |  |  |
| **S12** |  |  |  |  |  |  | 160 | 5 | 8 |  |  |
| **S13** |  |  |  |  | 50 | 5 | 156 | 11 | 21 |  |  |
| **S14** |  |  |  |  |  | 33 |  | 38 | 63 | 31 |  |
| **S15** |  |  |  |  |  | 26 |  | 47 | 90 | 32 |  |
| **S16** |  |  |  |  |  | 16 |  | 9 | 135 | 9 |  |
| **S17** |  |  |  |  |  | 79 |  | 3 | 59 | 19 |  |
| **S18** |  |  |  |  |  | 72 |  | 16 | 60 | 14 |  |
| **S19** |  |  |  |  |  | 62 |  | 35 | 121 | 9 |  |
| **S20** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 97 | 19 |  |  |
| **S21** |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | 65 | 34 |  |  |

| **S24** |  |  | 30 | 44 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 13 |
| **S25** |  | 33 | 19 | 19 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 21 |
| **S26** |  | 19 | 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 13 |

Read this table for **staffing conflicts**, not for totals. Columns that light up together in one row are teams that must not be the same people: S01 has 7 lanes active at once against a 10-engineer BE+FE pool, and it is the sprint most likely to discover that the lane model is aspirational.

## 29.4 Parallelisable lane pairs per sprint

Two lanes may be run by two independent teams in the same sprint **without a shared-module contract** when their module sets are disjoint and neither appears in the collision table (29.2). The pairs below are safe by construction and are how the sprint is split across teams at planning.

|---|---|---|---|
| Sprint Planning | Mon week 1, day 1 | lane leads + QA lead + Security + Architect + Owner | Committed sprint scope; any over-capacity resolved **before** commit |
| Daily stand-up | daily, per lane | lane | Blockers surfaced within 24h |
| Scrum-of-scrums | Wed each week | lane leads + Architect | Cross-lane blockers, contract changes |
| Design Review | weekly | CDO + designers + consuming FE lead | Design tickets move to Done (gates DoR two sprints out) |
| Backlog refinement | Wed week 2 | lane leads + QA + Owner | Next sprint DoR-ready; estimates via planning poker |
| Sprint Review / demo | Fri week 2 | whole team + Owner | Demo on staging; Owner acceptance recorded on tickets |
| Retro | Fri week 2 | whole team | Learnings -> Chore/action tickets |
| **Train check-in** | Fri week 2 of **every even sprint** | Architect + lane leads + QA + Security + Owner | Train health call: green / amber / red |
| **Train gate (PRR)** | last day of the train | PRR board per `07-release-and-prr.md` | Go / no-go on the release cut |

## 31.2 Train check-in agenda (the 6 questions)

Every even-sprint check-in answers exactly these, in this order, in writing:

1. **Burn-up vs plan.** Is cumulative eng points for this train on the line in section 30? State the delta in points *and* in sprints.
2. **Exit criteria evidence.** For each train exit criterion (roadmap 4.3/5.3/6.3/7.3/8.3/9.3), is there a *link* to evidence, or only an intention? Intentions count as red.
3. **Critical path.** Has any item on `E02->E06->E11->E12->E18->E26->E38->E44->E46->GA` or `E09->E27->E29->E32->E34->E43->E44` slipped? Any slip >1 sprint triggers the mandatory re-plan session (roadmap 13).
4. **Design-ahead health.** Are the design tickets for sprint *n+2* Done? If not, which FE stories will fail DoR, and is a CDO waiver being requested?
5. **Constraint check.** Which pool was actually binding last sprint - eng, QA, design or security? Compare against the assumed capacities in section 2.2 and adjust.
6. **Reserve position.** How much train buffer and named reserve remains? Reserves are reported as a number, never as "we should be fine".

## 31.3 Train health definitions

| Status | Definition | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| **Green** | Burn-up within 1 sprint of section 30; all exit criteria have evidence or a dated owner; no critical-path slip | Continue |
| **Amber** | Burn-up 1-2 sprints behind, **or** any pool over capacity two sprints running, **or** a design-ahead violation without a waiver | Descoping ladder (roadmap 12) opened at the next planning; Owner informed |
| **Red** | Burn-up >2 sprints behind, **or** critical-path slip >1 sprint, **or** an exit criterion with no credible path | Immediate re-plan session (Architect + affected lead + QA lead + Owner); risk-register entry; roadmap amendment at the train boundary |

## 31.4 Check-in schedule

| Check-in | Date | Train | Special focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| S02 check-in | 2026-10-23 | R0 | **Engine spike go/no-go (2026-10-23)** + first velocity recalibration (31.6) |
| S04 check-in | 2026-11-20 | R0 | **R0 gate / PRR-lite** + second velocity recalibration; R1 re-baselined here |
| S06 check-in | 2026-12-18 | R1 | R1 mid-train; **S06/S07 eng over-capacity must already be resolved**; engine core FPS trend |
| S08 check-in | 2027-01-15 | R1 | R1 pre-exit; golden-fixture corpus readiness; DAST first-run triage |
| S10 check-in | 2027-02-12 | R2 | R2 open; footprint render budget - the single number that decides R2 scope |
| S12 check-in | 2027-03-12 | R2 | R2 mid-train; **S13 QA pile-up decision must be made here, not in S13** |
| S14 check-in | 2027-04-09 | R3 | R3 open; safety ordering confirmed; design-ahead for S16-S17 verified |
| S16 check-in | 2027-05-07 | R3 | R3 mid-train; native-SL invariant evidence; **S19 QA over-commit mitigation decided here** |

| S20 check-in | 2027-07-02 | R4 | R4 open; **code-freeze readiness for 2027-07-02** |
| S22 check-in | 2027-07-30 | R4 | **R4 / Live-enablement gate** - highest-consequence check-in in the plan |
| S24 check-in | 2027-08-27 | R5 | R5 mid-train; defect burn-down trend; GA scope freeze |
| S26 check-in | 2027-09-24 | R5 | **GA** - PRR re-run + GA checklist |

## 31.5 What may and may not change

| Element | Changeable? | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Sprint dates (roadmap 1.1) | **No** | Fixed for the whole horizon. Scope moves between sprints; dates do not. |
| Train exit criteria | **No**, once the train has started | Owner decision recorded as an ADR + risk-register entry |
| Which train an epic rides | Only at a train boundary | Roadmap amendment (roadmap 13) |
| Ticket -> sprint assignment | **Yes**, at sprint planning | This document, amended in-place (31.9) |
| Estimates | **Yes**, at refinement | Planning poker; re-estimate is data, not failure |
| Assumed pool capacities (section 2.2) | **Yes** - that is the point | Velocity recalibration below |

## 31.6 Velocity recalibration after S02 and S04

The 90-pt engineering capacity and the design/QA/security pool sizes in section 2.2 are **assumptions inherited from the planning brief**. They have never been measured on this team, on this codebase. Two recalibration points are scheduled deliberately early, while the cost of being wrong is still small.

### Recalibration 1 - end of S02 (2026-10-23)

Two sprints of actuals exist. This is a *sanity* check, not a re-baseline: S01-S02 are scaffolding-heavy and unrepresentative of steady-state feature work.

**Inputs:** completed points per discipline for S01 and S02; carry-in/carry-out; the count of tickets that failed DoD on first review; actual PR cycle time vs the 400-LOC preference.

```
observed_velocity = mean(completed_eng_pts[S01], completed_eng_pts[S02])
estimate_bias     = completed_pts / originally_estimated_pts   # per discipline
```

| Observation | Action |
|---|---|
| `observed_velocity` within +/-15% of 90 | No change. Note it and move on. |
| `observed_velocity` < 76 pts | Do **not** re-baseline yet - flag amber, re-check at S04. Two scaffolding sprints are weak evidence. |
| `estimate_bias` consistently <0.8 in one discipline | That discipline is systematically over-estimating; recalibrate its reference stories at refinement, not its capacity number. |
| Any pool (design/QA/sec) finished <70% of its tickets | Its section 2.2 capacity is wrong. Adjust the number and re-run the flags in section 2.3. |

> S01 and S02 are planned at **90** and **89** eng pts against 90 - i.e. at the line. There is no slack to hide a low velocity in, which is precisely why this check-in is scheduled.

### Recalibration 2 - end of S04 (2026-11-20), at the R0 gate

**This one is a real re-baseline.** Four sprints of actuals, a completed train, and a PRR-lite gate that forces honest evidence. R1 is re-planned against the recalibrated numbers *before* S05 opens.

```
V = mean(completed_eng_pts[S01..S04])           # new engineering capacity
for pool in (design, qa, security):
    C[pool] = mean(completed_pts[pool][S01..S04])
scale = V / 90                                   # re-baseline factor
```

**Then, in this order:**

1. **Replace the capacity numbers** in section 2.2 and re-generate section 2.3. Record old and new values in the amendment log (31.9) - never silently overwrite.
2. **Re-run the flags.** Every sprint whose load now exceeds the recalibrated pool becomes a planning item. With `scale < 1`, expect the already-over sprints (S06 (101), S07 (61)) plus everything within 2 pts of the cap to go red.
3. **Do not move dates.** Apply the descoping ladder (roadmap 12) in its pre-agreed order, starting at item 1, until each train fits. The ladder exists precisely so this decision is not made under pressure.
4. **Protect the never-cut list.** E32 native SL, E39 kill-switch + risk caps, E09 RBAC, E27 key vault, E42 audit completeness, E43/E44 pen-test + Live gate, E47 a11y Level A, E45 reconciliation. Cutting any of these needs a written Owner decision, an ADR and a risk-register entry, and it **blocks the Live-enablement gate by default**.
5. **Re-check design-ahead.** If engineering slows, design gets *further* ahead, which is safe. If design slows, FE stories start failing DoR two sprints later - that is the dangerous direction and it must be called out explicitly.
6. **Re-forecast GA.** State the new GA date implied by `V` even if the answer is unwelcome. At `V = 75`, the 1986 planned eng points need ~26 sprints of pure delivery against 26 available - report how much reserve remains, not a reassurance.

### Ongoing recalibration

After S04, velocity is re-computed as a **rolling 3-sprint mean** at every train check-in. A single bad sprint never triggers a re-plan; two consecutive sprints below 85% of the rolling mean does.

## 31.7 Re-plan triggers (any one fires a session)

| Trigger | Detected at | Session attendees | Deadline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Critical-path item slips >1 sprint | Any stand-up or check-in | Architect + affected lead + QA lead + Owner | Within 2 working days |
| Rolling velocity <85% of mean for 2 sprints | Train check-in | Lane leads + Architect + Owner | Next sprint planning |
| A pool over capacity 2 sprints running | Train check-in | That pool lead + Architect + Owner | Next sprint planning |
| Engine spike returns no-go (S02) | 2026-10-23 | Architect + CDO + Owner | Immediately - R1 is re-planned wholesale |
| Pen-test findings exceed the 90-pt reserve | S21 | Security + Architect + Owner | Within 2 working days; Live gate date is at risk |
| Soak failure in S19 or S25 | q09 / q11 | QA lead + Architect + Owner | Immediately - these have near-zero recovery margin |
| A never-cut item is proposed for cutting | Anywhere | Owner (decision), Architect, Security | ADR before the decision is actioned |

## 31.8 Sprints already known to need re-planning

These are not predictions - they are arithmetic from the current backlog, visible today.

| Sprint | Problem | Decide by | Pre-agreed remedy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S01** | design 63 vs 60 (+3) | S01 planning | Absorb from the train buffer or apply the descoping ladder (roadmap 12) in order. |
| **S02** | design 98 vs 60 (+38) | S01 planning | Absorb from the train buffer or apply the descoping ladder (roadmap 12) in order. |
| **S04** | **QA 65 vs 45 (+20)**; design 81 vs 60 (+21); sec 26 vs 20 (+6) | S02 check-in | QA pile-up is R0-exit evidence. Move non-gate-blocking evidence tasks into S05, which opens with zero QA load. |
| **S05** | design 80 vs 60 (+20) | S04 check-in | Absorb from the train buffer or apply the descoping ladder (roadmap 12) in order. |
| **S06** | 101 eng vs 90 (+11) | S04 check-in | Draw the R1 buffer, or move the non-gating E16 retention tasks to S09 (which has ~30 free eng pts inside the same train). |
| **S07** | 61 eng vs 45 (+16) | S06 check-in | Holiday sprint at 45 pts. Nothing on the critical path may start here; move the overage to S08/S09 at S06 planning and absorb the remainder from the R1 buffer. |
| **S08** | **QA 60 vs 45 (+15)** | S06 check-in | Split the QA load with S09 (R1 exit evidence can start one sprint early against recorded fixtures). |
| **S09** | **QA 50 vs 45 (+5)** | S08 check-in | R1-exit QA. Front-load fixture-dependent suites into S08 and keep only gate evidence here. |
| **S12** | **QA 55 vs 45 (+10)** | S10 check-in | Move non-gating order-flow correctness cases into S14, which opens R3 lightly on QA. |
| **S13** | **QA 83 vs 45 (+38)** | S12 check-in | R2-exit evidence pile-up. Per roadmap 12, move non-gate-blocking QA to S14 and re-sequence the design tickets consumed here; decide at the S12 check-in. |
| **S15** | design 66 vs 60 (+6); sec 21 vs 20 (+1) | S14 check-in | Absorb from the train buffer or apply the descoping ladder (roadmap 12) in order. |
| **S18** | **QA 46 vs 45 (+1)** | S16 check-in | One point over - absorb, no action beyond noting it. |
| **S19** | **QA 113 vs 45 (+68)**; sec 30 vs 20 (+10) | S18 check-in | QA cannot absorb this under any assumption. Pull descoping-ladder items #6 (E40 webhook delivery) and #7 (E41 advanced analytics) into R5 now, and move non-gate-blocking QA into S20. The 7-day soak closing one day before the gate is the real constraint and cannot be compressed. |
| **S23** | design 66 vs 60 (+6) | S22 check-in | Design overage is GA-polish work with no hard date - spread across S24-S25, which carry almost no design load. |

Two structural notes the table cannot express:

- **R1 is the tight train.** It carries 399 eng pts against 405 of holiday-adjusted capacity, so it fits only with near-perfect packing, and S07 at 45 pts forces the pinch into S06. Every S06/S07 ticket is pinned by a same-train dependent, so relieving this needs a human call - absorb from the train buffer, descope per roadmap 12, or raise S07 capacity. This is a roadmap 12 decision, not a data error.
- **QA is the binding constraint of the whole plan.** 7 of 26 sprints exceed the QA pool; engineering exceeds its cap in 2. Every mitigation above that moves QA work sideways assumes the receiving sprint's QA column stays under 45 - check that before committing the move.

## 31.9 Amendment log

All scope moves between sprints are recorded here. Roadmap-level changes go to `30-release-roadmap.md` at a train boundary instead (roadmap 13).

| Date | Sprint(s) | Change | Reason | Decided by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-14 | - | Initial plan generated from `backlog/all-tickets.json` | Planning phase | basiltt |
| 2026-09-15 | all | Regenerated against the completed backlog (49 epic files, 1302 children, 3985 pts) | All 49 roadmap epics now have backlog files; the previous revision was built on 42 | basiltt |
| 2026-09-15 | S02-S09 | Inserted **E50** (statechart contracts & xstate-statemachine adoption readiness, 25 tickets, 85 pts) into the sprint tables and refreshed every derived total | ADR-0016 / roadmap 3.1.1: the statechart linter and contract suite must ship before the first statechart (MUST-09). See `backlog/_reconciliation-report.md` 14. | basiltt |

# 32. Gap register - what this plan cannot yet schedule

`backlog/_reconciliation-report.md` is the authority here. As of this revision it reports **4 errors** and 142 warnings; the warnings are all `LONG-TITLE` (cosmetic, >80 chars) and are not planning items.

## 32.1 Resolved since the previous revision

| Previously | Status now |
|---|---|
| 7 epics with no backlog file (E08, E09, E12, E14, E15, E19, E47 - 296 roadmap pts) | **Resolved.** All 49 roadmap epics have files; those 7 contribute 276 child tickets to the sprint tables above. |
| 10 design-ahead violations in S13 (E24-D05, E25-D07) | **Resolved** by pulling the design chains 1-2 sprints earlier (reconciliation report 12). |
| `E26-S07` inverted `blocked_by: E38` | **Resolved** - blocker removed, reason recorded on the ticket `notes`. |
| Dangling `blocked_by` references | **Zero.** All 3045 dependency links resolve, 530 of them to a whole epic. |

## 32.2 Open errors (2) — post-adoption re-plan 2026-09-24

ADR-0016 is **Accepted**: `xstate-statemachine==0.9.1` is adopted completely (no shim, no dual-runtime harness). 59 E50 tickets are retired at 0 pts (label `retired`, sprint `Backlog`; validate.py counts them in no pool). The E50 build now fits R0 (S02–S04), with the BLOCKING `tests/xstate_contract` gate (`E50-T31`), gateway (`E50-T15`), nightly `run_gate.py` (`E50-T04`) and event-coverage gate landing in S04. S05 (+5) and S06 (+14) overages are gone. Remaining, pre-accepted:

- `OVER-CAPACITY Sprint 07: 47 eng pts vs capacity 45 (+2)` — holiday sprint, baseline E11–E15 charting chain, 0 E50 eng pts.
- `TRAIN-OVER-CAPACITY R1: 407 eng pts vs 405 available` — same 2 pts.

Absorbed from the R1 train buffer per roadmap §12. The secondary gates `E50-T05`/`E50-T06` and upstream contributions `E50-C01`/`E50-C02` moved to S17/S19 headroom (non-critical; no R1 exit criterion depends on them). Full before/after: `backlog/_reconciliation-report.md` §17.

## 32.3 Unscheduled tickets

4 tickets (8 pts) sit in `Backlog` with no sprint. They are small and non-blocking, but "Backlog" is not a decision - each must be scheduled or explicitly deferred at the next refinement.

| Key | Title | Kind | Est | Parent epic | Suggested disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `E20-S05` | Rolling N-bar sparkline per Deep-Stats row | Story | 3 | E20 | R5 polish - it is a presentation refinement on an already-shipped row. |
| `E22-S06` | Big-trade (whale) alerts with flood control | Story | 2 | E22 | Fold into E40 alerts in R3, or defer to R5 with ladder item #6. |
| `E23-S06` | Composite normalised CVD across up to five symbols | Story | 2 | E23 | Descoping-ladder item #4 (multi-symbol CVD) - defer to R5 by default. |
| `E40-S03` | Ship HMAC-signed webhook alert delivery with allow-listed egress | Story | 1 | E40 | Descoping-ladder item #6 (webhook delivery) - defer to R5 by default. |

# 33. Backlog import

How `docs/plan/backlog/all-tickets.json` maps onto the GitHub Project at <https://github.com/users/basiltt/projects/10> (PenniLogic-style schema, per `00-planning-brief.md`).

## 33.1 Source of truth

`all-tickets.json` is a flat JSON array of **1377 objects** (**50** epics + **1327** children), assembled from the per-epic files `backlog/E01.json .. E50.json` and validated by `backlog/_tools/validate.py`, whose output is `backlog/_reconciliation-report.md`.

**The JSON is the source of truth for the initial import only.** After import, GitHub Issues become the source of truth for status and assignment; the JSON remains the source of truth for *structure* (parentage, dependencies, estimates) until the first train boundary, after which the board wins outright. Do not re-run a full import over a live board.

## 33.2 Field mapping

| JSON field | Type | GitHub target | Mapping rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `key` | string (`E12-S03`) | Issue **title prefix** | Title is rendered as `<key>: <title>`. The key is the only stable cross-reference and must survive into the issue title - board filters, this document and `blocked_by` all key off it. |
| `title` | string | Issue title (after the prefix) | 121 titles exceed 80 chars (`LONG-TITLE` warnings); truncate for display only, never in the issue. |
| `kind` | `Epic`/`Story`/`Task`/`Spike`/`Chore` | Project field **Kind** + `type/*` label | Task 961, Story 274, Spike 50, Chore 17 |
| `labels` | string[] | Issue labels | ~57 distinct labels. Create them all before step 4 or the API silently drops unknown ones. |
| `component` | string | Project field **Component** | Vocabulary: alerts, api, auth, backtesting, chart-engine, cross-cutting, data-feeds, docs, drawing-tools, indicators, infra, scripting, web. |
| `phase` | `P0 Foundations` .. `P5 Collaboration & Polish` | Project field **Phase** | 1:1 with milestone; kept because the board schema has both. |
| `sprint` | `Sprint 01` .. `Sprint 26`, or `Backlog` | Project field **Sprint** (iteration) | Iterations must be created with the exact dates from section 2.3. `Backlog` maps to *no iteration*, not to an iteration named "Backlog" (4 tickets, section 32.3). |
| `priority` | `P0 Critical` .. `P3 Low` | Project field **Priority** | Also duplicated as a `priority/*` label - see caveat 2. |
| `perspective` | `Product`/`Development`/`Test`/`Security`/`Architecture`/`QA`/`Ops`/`Compliance` | Project field **Perspective** | Free-text single select. |
| `risk` | `R<n> <name>` or `None` | Project field **Risk** | Cross-references `32-risk-register.md`; `None` is a legitimate value, not a null. |
| `estimate` | int (Fibonacci 1-8; epics roll up) | Project field **Estimate** | Child estimates only are summed in this document. Epic estimates are roadmap-level and must **not** be added to sprint totals or every point is counted twice. |
| `parent` | key or `null` | **Sub-issue** relationship | `null` => epic. Every one of the 1327 children has a parent that exists. |
| `blocked_by` | key[] | Issue **relationship** / `Blocked by` | 2831 links total, 343 of which name a whole epic rather than a ticket - legitimate, see caveat 3. |
| `milestone` | `R0 Foundations` .. `R5 Hardening / GA` | **Milestone** | Due date = train end date from roadmap 1.1. |
| `body` | markdown | Issue body | Already DoR-shaped: context, acceptance criteria in Gherkin, test plan, security notes, a11y notes, DoD, out-of-scope, doc references. |
| `notes` | markdown (1 ticket) | Appended to the issue body under `## Planning notes` | Only `E26-S07` carries it (the resolved inverted dependency). |

## 33.3 Derived fields the importer must compute

| Target field | Derivation |
|---|---|
| **Start** | Monday of the `sprint` iteration (section 2.3 column 2) |
| **Due** | Friday of the `sprint` iteration (section 2.3 column 3) |
| **Status** | Always `Backlog` at import - no ticket is pre-promoted to Ready |
| **Discipline** (if the board has it) | From the key letter: `S`/`T`/`K`/`C` -> Engineering, `D` -> Design, `Q` -> QA, `X` -> Security (section 1.1) |
| **Lane** (if the board has it) | From the `parent` epic via the lane table in section 29.1 |
| **Rollup** | Epic estimate = sum of child estimates; recompute after import rather than trusting the JSON epic estimate, which is the roadmap figure |

## 33.4 Import order (dependencies force this sequence)

```
1. Milestones      x6      R0..R5, due dates = train end dates (roadmap 1.1)
2. Labels          ~57     all type/*, area/*, priority/* and gate labels
3. Project fields          Kind, Phase, Sprint (26 iterations), Component,
                           Priority, Perspective, Risk, Estimate, Status
4. Epic issues     x49      parent == null; record key -> issue number
5. Child issues    x1327    set the sub-issue parent during creation
6. Second pass             resolve blocked_by keys -> issue numbers, set relationships
7. Field values            set all project fields from the JSON + derived values
8. Validation              re-run the checks below
```

Steps 4-5 must not be parallelised across epics: a child may be `blocked_by` a ticket in another epic, and step 6 needs the full key->number map.

## 33.5 Sub-issue and blocked-by relationships

| Relationship | Count | Shape | Import rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sub-issue (epic -> child) | 1327 | Exactly one parent per child; depth 1 (no child-of-child) | Set at creation (step 5). An epic's progress bar is then automatic. |
| Blocked-by (ticket -> ticket) | 2488 | DAG; may cross epics and trains | Step 6 only. Zero dangling references today - if the importer finds one, stop and fix the JSON, do not create a placeholder issue. |
| Blocked-by (ticket -> epic) | 343 | "blocked until that whole epic is Done" | Legitimate. Link to the epic issue; the board shows it as blocked until the epic closes. |

Dependency direction is **`blocked_by`**, i.e. the edge points *backwards*: `A.blocked_by = [B]` means B must finish first. The roadmap 11.1 graph draws the same edges forwards (`B --> A`); do not invert them during import (this is exactly the bug that produced the `E26-S07` error in the previous revision).

## 33.6 Post-import validation

The import is not complete until all of these pass:

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| Issue count | 1377 (50 epics + 1327 children) |
| Every child has a parent | 1327 sub-issue links |
| Every `blocked_by` resolved | 0 dangling references |
| Sum of Estimate by Sprint | matches section 2.3 exactly, per discipline |
| Total points | eng 1986 / design 918 / QA 802 / security 356 = 4062 |
| Milestone distribution | R0: 205; R1: 251; R2: 264; R3: 405; R4: 73; R5: 104 |
| Kind distribution | Task 961; Story 274; Spike 50; Chore 17 |
| All issues Status=Backlog | no ticket is pre-promoted to Ready |
| Unscheduled | exactly 4 tickets with no iteration (section 32.3) |

## 33.7 Known import caveats

1. **Duplicate priority encoding.** Both `priority` (field) and `priority/*` (label) exist, and the label vocabulary is inconsistent - `priority/p0` (539 uses) and `priority/p0-critical` (25 uses) both appear. Normalise to one form during import or board filters will silently miss tickets.
2. **`blocked_by` sometimes names an epic, not a ticket** (343 links). That is legitimate; the importer must not treat it as dangling.
3. **The JSON has no assignee.** Assignment happens at sprint planning, via the lane model in section 29.1.
4. **Re-import is destructive.** There is no idempotency key beyond the title prefix. If the import must be re-run, delete the project and issues first, or match on the `<key>:` title prefix and update in place.
5. **Body content is DoR-shaped but not DoR-complete.** Gherkin acceptance criteria are present; estimates were not set by planning poker with this team. Every ticket still needs the DoR checklist walked at refinement before it moves to Ready.
6. **Epic estimates are roadmap figures, not rollups.** Import them into a separate field or recompute from children; adding both to a sprint total double-counts every point.
