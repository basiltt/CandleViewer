# docs/plan — Index

Date: 2026-09-14 · Status: **planning phase complete, baseline for build**. This file is the map of every
planning document in `docs/plan/`, with a one-line abstract and a recommended reading order per role. It
does not restate content owned elsewhere (see `CONSTITUTION.md` C-16.5 for the single-source registry) —
it only points.

Precedence reminder: `CONSTITUTION.md` > `AGENTS.md` > everything below > tool defaults.

Not yet created at this path: `31-sprint-plan.md` (per-sprint ticket detail — tracked separately as the
board itself is the live source once Sprint 01 starts) and `docs/plan/backlog/*.json` (ticket tree —
produced as a follow-on artifact, not part of this planning-doc set).

## 2. Reading order by role

### Developer (backend or frontend)
1. `CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md` (repo root)
2. `00-planning-brief.md` → `docs/research/24-owner-decisions.md`
3. `01-sdlc-and-branching.md`, `02-definition-of-ready-done.md`
4. `20-architecture.md` (§4.4 statechart contracts + hot-path exclusion) → `21-database-schema.md` → `22-api-openapi.yaml` + `23-ws-protocol.md` + `24-internal-schemas.md` → `28-statechart-catalogue.md` (**required before any lifecycle ticket**)
5. `26-chart-engine-design.md` (frontend/engine work only)
6. `03-testing-strategy.md`, `04-security-program.md` (if touching a `security`-labelled path), `06-performance-and-load-standard.md`
7. `14-screens-catalogue.md` + `15-component-catalogue.md` + `16-design-system-brief.md` (any UI ticket)
8. `27-adrs/` for the specific decision behind the area being touched

### Designer (product design / design system / UX research)
1. `00-planning-brief.md`, `10-personas.md`
2. `12-sitemap.md` → `13-user-flows.md` → `17-ux-diagrams.md`
3. `14-screens-catalogue.md`, `15-component-catalogue.md`, `16-design-system-brief.md`
4. `05-accessibility-standard.md` (§11 design-system requirements are binding on sign-off)
5. `01-sdlc-and-branching.md` §3/§9 (design-ahead rule, ceremonies), `02-definition-of-ready-done.md` §3 (Story DoR design-ready checklist)

### QA / SDET
1. `00-planning-brief.md`, `02-definition-of-ready-done.md`
2. `03-testing-strategy.md` (primary owned document)
3. `11-user-stories.md` (acceptance criteria to trace)
4. `05-accessibility-standard.md` §9–10, `06-performance-and-load-standard.md` §7–8
5. `04-security-program.md` §11–14 (security review process, acceptance-criteria templates)
6. `07-release-and-prr.md` (PRR/QA sign-off gates)

### Security engineer / DevSecOps
1. `CONSTITUTION.md` §12 (security constitution), `SECURITY.md`
2. `04-security-program.md` (primary owned document)
3. `20-architecture.md`, `21-database-schema.md`, `24-internal-schemas.md` (trust boundaries, secrets, OMS), `28-statechart-catalogue.md` §B8/B17/B18/B20 (native-SL, live gate, kill switch, risk lockout — and why none of them *enforces*)
4. `01-sdlc-and-branching.md` §6/§7 (required checks), `03-testing-strategy.md` §11 (SAST/DAST/SCA gates)
5. `07-release-and-prr.md` §6 (Live-enablement gate), `32-risk-register.md` (Security-category and R4/R5/R6 risks)

### AI coding agent
1. `AGENTS.md` §0 reading order (this is the authoritative agent on-ramp; follow it verbatim)
2. `CONSTITUTION.md` in full before touching any file
3. The assigned GitHub issue
4. Whichever of the docs above are named on the ticket's `blocked_by`/references fields
5. This README only to locate a doc by number/topic — never as a substitute for reading the doc itself

## 3. Where the truth lives

Do not duplicate content from another owned document into a new one. The sole-owner registry is
maintained in `CONSTITUTION.md` §16.5 — consult it, not a copy, whenever two documents appear to disagree.
