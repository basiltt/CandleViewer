# 28 — Statechart Catalogue (lifecycle contracts executed by `xstate-statemachine`)

Date: 2026-09-15 (revised 2026-09-24) · Status: **normative**. Governing decision: [`27-adrs/ADR-0016-statechart-runtime.md`](27-adrs/ADR-0016-statechart-runtime.md) — **Accepted (2026-09-24)**: every contract here is executed by **`xstate-statemachine==0.9.1`** via `cv.statechart.factory`. There is no in-house shim.

---

> **2026-09-24 — full adoption (ADR-0016 Decision (final)). Current position.** The JSON below is loaded unmodified by `cv.statechart.factory.build(chart_id)` and run on the library under the FINAL mandatory configuration (§1.3c). The factory injects `"strictConfig": true` and `"maxIterations": 500` at build time. Four our-side chart defects found during verification are **merged** here, each marked *Corrected 2026-09-24* in its entry: **B16** C-04 (revocation hoisted to root → `elevation.dead`; region `REVOKE` deleted), **B18** C-07b (`onUnhandled: "defer"` + ordered unguarded `RELEASE` audit arm), **B11** (event-aware `all_streams_healthy` / `reasons_remain`; `degraded` handles `GAP_DETECTED`), **B8** B610-OC-CD03 (bounded `fallback_attempts` on the `naked ⇄ verifying` loop). This closes gate P3-G1 once `tests/xstate_contract/` is green on them. Inline `// CV-C31…` comments inside JSON blocks are historical; the policy keys themselves are authoritative, and comments are stripped by the factory loader.
>
> **Round-6 catalogue corrections (2026-09-20, ADR-0016 Amendment 6).** `actionErrorPolicy: "fail"` is **re-permitted and in places required** (#145 verified; CV-C31 retired and inverted by CV-C31′ — `"rollback"` is now the unsafe policy on an `invoke`-carrying state with a raisable entry action, upstream R6-03). `onUnhandled: "error"` is **removed from B18** (C-07b: a guard-denied `RELEASE` bricks the kill switch). New structural rules CV-C35 (no `always` into an invoked child), CV-C36, CV-C37; **CV-C30 retired** — parallel regions are safe again now that #142/#143 enforce one legality predicate on both snapshot sides. Outstanding on our side: the explicit `halted` states CV-C31 promised were never written (C-07), plus C-04 (B16 elevation survives `LOGOUT`/`REVOKE`), CV-B4-01, C-06, OUR-B11-01, OUR-B14-01 — all ticketed in `E50-T14`/`E50-T16`. See `docs/research/xstate/39-r6-final-readiness-verdict.md` §4/§7.
>
> **Round-5 catalogue corrections (2026-09-19, CV-C34/CV-C31):** all `"*": {"actions": ["defer"]}` scaffolding removed (OC-01 — it pre-empted `onUnhandled: "defer"` and silently disabled `strict`); `actionErrorPolicy: "fail"` withdrawn everywhere in favour of `"rollback"` + explicit `halted` states (R5-12). Invariant gaps OC-02…OC-10 (B2, B4, B8, B11, B14, B16, B19) are ticketed in E50-T14 and their corrected JSON lives in `docs/research/xstate/battle-3ed3099/contracts/*.machine.json` pending merge here.


## 0. What this document is, and what it is not

This document is the **behavioural contract** for every long-lived lifecycle in CandleViewer. For each of the twenty components analysed in `docs/research/xstate/10-fit-analysis.md` Part B it gives the XState-v5-compatible statechart JSON, the event / guard / action / service tables derived from that JSON, and the invariants the implementation must satisfy.

**It is executed by `xstate-statemachine`.** A contract names *states, events, guards, actions and services*; the library interprets the JSON directly, and our Python supplies only the `logic` (guards, actions, services) bound by name. The executor is fixed by ADR-0016 (Accepted):

| Aspect | Value |
|---|---|
| Executor | `xstate-statemachine==0.9.1` (hash-locked, PEP 740 attested), async `Interpreter` in production |
| Construction | `services/api/candleviewer/statechart/factory.py` (`cv.statechart.factory`) — the only call site of `create_machine` / `Interpreter` / `Interpreter.from_snapshot` |
| Configuration | FINAL mandatory block, §1.3c |
| Hot paths | never a chart (§1.2); per-tick rule evaluation stays plain Python (BENCH-2 380.9 ev/s vs 2,000) |

### The three ways to read this

1. **You are implementing a lifecycle.** The owning tickets (E08, E16, E26, E29, E32, E33, E34, E35, E39, E40, E44, E45) load the JSON here through `cv.statechart.factory` and implement only the named guards, actions and services as the machine's `logic`. You do **not** hand-roll transitions. The JSON is the program; the contract suite (`E50-T03`, `tests/xstate_contract/`) asserts its golden traces on the library.
2. **You are reviewing a lifecycle.** The contract is the specification. If the code and the JSON disagree, the JSON is right and the code is a defect.
3. **You are wondering whether something should be a statechart.** Read §1. The answer is *no* far more often than the state-shaped feel of a problem suggests.

### What is *not* here

- Hot paths. See §1.2. The exclusion is architectural and measured, not a preference.
- Enum definitions, field types and persistence schemas. Those are owned by [`24-internal-schemas.md`](24-internal-schemas.md); this document links to the owning section and does not restate it (`CONSTITUTION.md` §16.5 single-source rule).
- The factory, the linter, the gateway, the reaper and the persistence envelope. Those are ADR-0016 (Decision (final)), `20-architecture.md` §statechart runtime, `24-internal-schemas.md`, and epic `E50` / `E29-T10`–`E29-T12`.

## 1. Scope — what is a contract here, and what must never be one

### 1.1 In scope (the adopt-for list, `11-adversarial-review.md` §5)

| [§B14](#b14--book-health-fsm-data-path-excluded) | Book health FSM (data path excluded) | `book` | E08 | 20-architecture.md §3.2 (book engine), §4.2 (backpressure) | **Not suitable** (data path) / Good (health FSM with the data path excluded) | health transitions only - resync/desync, not deltas |

### 1.2 Out of scope — never a statechart, in any form

From `11-adversarial-review.md` §5 "Do not use for" and MUSTNOT-01/02/05. These are not "discouraged"; they are forbidden, including as internal (actions-only) transitions.

| # | Path | Measured reason |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Book-engine delta application, bar builders, footprint aggregation | 48k ev/s against a ~9–20k process budget, and a 33 µs transition tax on 15–60 µs of real work |
| 2 | Per-tick rule **condition** evaluation | plain Python does the entire unfiltered 200,000 eval/s workload in 30 ms — **~744×** the statechart fleet; no pre-filter closes the gap |
| 3 | Paper-matcher fill model, queue-position estimator, fee/funding arithmetic | no states, and it needs virtual time no runtime here provides |
| 4 | Per-account rate-limit governor / fan-out admission control | **~238,000×** slower (35.2 ms p50 vs 0.148 µs) and structurally unable to answer synchronously |
| 5 | Any synchronous safety **enforcement** point — kill switch, live gate, risk caps, rate budgets | a statechart **records and orchestrates**; a synchronous flag or function **enforces** |

> The rate-limit governor is the canonical trap: it has states (`open` / `starved` / `downshifted`), it has transitions, it looks textbook, and it is on this list. Anything on the order path that must **return an answer** rather than **record a fact** cannot be a statechart.

### 1.3 House rules every contract in this document obeys

These are `10-fit-analysis.md` Part A, enforced by the machine-definition linter (`E29-T10`) and the conformance suite (`E50-T03`) rather than by review discipline.

| Rule | Statement | Visible in the contracts as |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** | No action may raise. Ever. | every action is `@cv_action`-wrapped; a fault routes to a quarantine/error state |
| **A2** | Timing lives outside the statechart. | no `after` anywhere in this catalogue; every deadline is an absolute `*_us` timestamp in context, armed by the `MonotonicScheduler` |
| **A3** | Every transient state has an explicit deferral handler. | ~~`` plus `drain_deferred` on entry~~ — **superseded 2026-09-17** by `onUnhandled: "defer"` in the policy block (§1.3b) |
| **A4** | Self-transitions must say `reenter: true`. | every self-target in this document carries it; `always` self-targets are a build error |
| **A5** | Absolute targets only, validated at build time. | every `target` is `#machine.path.to.state`; CI resolves each one against the state tree |
| **A6** | Guards are pure, total, and deny-by-default on safety paths. | safety guards prove permission; failure or exception means **blocked** |
| **A7** | The statechart is never the book of record. | Postgres is authoritative; every transition write-ahead-logs before the in-memory state changes |
| **A8** | Operational hygiene. | shared machine definitions, thread-safe sends through the gateway, compact snapshots |

The nine MUST-NOTs and twelve MUSTs from `11-adversarial-review.md` §3 are reproduced in full in ADR-0016 and are binding on every machine below.

### 1.3b The mandatory policy block (added 2026-09-17, ADR-0016 Amendment 1)

Every contract in this document opens with the same six keys, immediately after `"id"`. They are **normative and non-negotiable**: two of the four Blockers closed in `xstate-statemachine` 0.8.0 (`LC-01` action-raises, `LC-03` unhandled-events) are closed by a per-machine policy whose **default still reproduces the old, silent behaviour**. A machine that omits them is a machine with two open Blockers.

```jsonc
"actionErrorPolicy": "rollback",   // DEFAULT. CV-C31' RETIRED on the async lane (2026-09-21) and
                                   // CV-C31" RETIRED OUTRIGHT (2026-09-22): #193 unwinds a `def`

                                   // entire ground. The surviving ROLL-FORWARD leak (R9-04) is a
                                   // different shape, carried by CV-C32 + CV-C46, not by a policy ban.
                                   // Wrapper attempt counter STILL REQUIRED on any rollback +
                                   // invoke.onDone state: the storm is bounded (maxIterations+2) but

                                   // Order-path states with invoke + raisable entry still use "fail".
                                   // CV-C31 (the blanket ban on "fail") remains RETIRED: #145 verified.

                                   // a non-downgradable RootTargetError at build time
"strict":            true,         // undeclared event names raise at the call site. #190/#195/#203

                                   // => CV-C45's SEND-SIDE CLAUSE RETIRES. The RESTORE-side clause
                                   //    does NOT, and is WIDENED, on two surviving residuals:

> **Round-10 amendments (2026-09-22, ADR-0016 Amendment 10). Current position.** The keys are
> unchanged; five things about how to read them are.
> **(1) `strict` now carries its own weight on the send side.** #203 closed R9-02 at
> `base_interpreter.py:4624`, so **CV-C45's send-side clause retires** — the gateway no longer needs
> to reject externally submitted `AfterEvent`s, because the engine refuses them itself with a named
> `UnknownEventError` on both spellings, at the *default* `strict=false`. **The restore-side clause
> does not retire and is widened**: match the serialised record `kind` as well as the class, and
> **re-arm deadlines explicitly from context** (CV-C48), because a pre-0.8.1 `after` record is now
> silently *dropped* rather than demoted.
> **(2) The order path may run on `SyncInterpreter` again — CV-C46 RETIRES.** Its entire ground was
> R9-04's sync-engine roll-forward leaks; #204 closed them (`LD-01` 3 leaks → 0/6) and the
> `167 rollback_reinvoke_spin` cell now passes 5/5. **CV-C32 also retires as a *safety* rule** while
> the rule stands verbatim, re-grounded on R10-D2: an invoke-bearing state with an escape transition
> cannot be pre-empted on the `def` lane, so the escape is not an escape (binds B12 `buffering`,
> B12 `stepping`, B13 `subscribing`). The async engine remains our order-path engine by preference,
> not by containment.
> **(3) A SELF-TARGETING TRANSITION IS INTERNAL BY CONTRACT — `"reenter": true` is mandatory** on any
> self-targeting `onDone`/`on` meant to **restart** a state's invoke or entry actions. XState v5 makes
> internal the default with `reenter` as the opt-in, and this library follows it. Without `reenter`,
> the invoke arms exactly once and never again (`submits = 1` forever); with it, every lane re-arms
> to `maxIterations + 2` and the `#207` stranded hook fires. The library's validator warns for the
> `always` case only, so **our lint must cover the `onDone`/`on` case** (R10-02, refuted — the defect
> was our chart, and it cost a round to establish).
> **(4) Kill/cancel is declared on an ANCESTOR of every invoking state (CV-C4x), never only on
> siblings.** Measured: sibling-only holds the kill **1.458 s** against a 1.5 s service; a
> parent-level handler **0.001 s**; a handler on the invoking state itself **0.000 s**. `priority=True`
> does not help — it is an inbox lane, not configuration-level selection. Statically lintable, and it
> is the whole of R10-C4 once that finding is refuted down to a modelling error.
> **(5) Observability never polls `last_error` (CV-C50).** `RunawayChainError` is **cleared once
> settled on the `async def` lane and retained on the `def` lane**, so a supervisor sampling
> asynchronously sees the runaway on `def` services and **misses it on the recommended `async def`
> ones**. `CvErrorHooks` implements `on_invocation_stranded` and samples
> `on_event_dropped(..., "chain_budget")`; the health sweep asserts `has_dormant_invocations() is
> False`. Also: **snapshot only with no armed delayed self-`raise` debt** (CV-C49) — an armed-but-
> unfired self-delay has no snapshot representation at all and is discharged silently on restore,
> wedging any state whose only exit was that event.

Only the first two vary, and only by machine role:

| Value | Machines | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `actionErrorPolicy: "fail"` **re-permitted (CV-C31 retired, 2026-09-20)** | B8, B17, B18, B20, **and any order-path state carrying an `invoke` with a raisable entry action (CV-C31′)** | #145 verified on both engines: halts with `status="stopped"` and a cleared configuration, retains `TransitionFailedError`, round-trips through a snapshot, and the halted blob is refused by `from_snapshot` with `InvalidConfigError`. R5-12 (reverts to source, bricks the interpreter) is dead. Pair with an explicit `halted` state entered from `on_transition_failed` — **these states are still missing (C-07, `E50-T16`)**. |
| `actionErrorPolicy: "rollback"` | all others | Restore context and configuration; the transition never half-commits. **Not safe on a state that carries an `invoke` and can raise in an entry action** — upstream R6-03 makes that an unbounded, silent re-invocation loop on the async engine. |
| `onUnhandled: "error"` | B13 `ws_conn`, B14 `book` — **no longer B18** | Control machines have a closed event vocabulary; an unexpected event is a bug, not backlog. **Removed from B18 (C-07b):** a guard-denied `RELEASE` is terminal under this policy, i.e. the kill switch is bricked by a wrong button press. Note also R6-08: the kill is visible via `status`/`.error`/`on_error` but the caller's `Receipt` is byte-identical to a no-op. |
| `onUnhandled: "defer"` | all others | An event arriving before its handler is armed is held at the **head** of the queue and replayed in order. |

Three consequences that shape how the machines below are written:

- **`rollback` is a context + configuration transaction, not an effect transaction.** A `sendTo` or `raise` emitted by an *earlier* action in the same list survives the rollback. So **the action that talks to the outside world is always last in its list**, or lives on the `entry` of a state that is only reached once the transition has committed (constraint CV-C02). Check this whenever editing an `actions` array below.

  > **Narrowed on `main` @ `5327ba6` (pre-0.8.1), but unchanged as a rule.** Rollback now also **withdraws self-`raise`d events** queued by the failed action list — verified in eight hostile shapes including parallel regions and child actors. It still **cannot un-send a `sendTo`** (that effect has left the machine), and the library says so explicitly. CV-C02 is therefore unchanged: keep outward effects last, or on the committed state's `entry`.
- **No event may be named `error.*` or `done.*`.** Those namespaces are reserved by the engine: such names are invisible to a `"*"` handler and exempt from `onUnhandled: "error"` (constraint CV-C15). Enforced by the event-name gate `E50-T05`.

  > **Re-scoped on `main` @ `3c527b0` (unreleased 0.8.1), and narrowed.** #79 replaced the name-based exemption with provenance, so a *user-sent* `done.review` or `error.validation` is now fully visible to `"*"`, trips `onUnhandled: "error"`, and is rejected by `strict` — **case variants included**. The blanket `done.`/`error.` ban is therefore over-broad and its case-insensitivity requirement **retires**.
  >
  > **The rule becomes:** no CandleViewer event may be named with any prefix in `ENGINE_EVENT_SHAPES` — **`done.invoke.`, `done.state.`, `error.platform.`, `after.`, `xstate.`, `___xstate`**. These are the only names `models.is_known_event` still exempts **by name**, so a typo inside them is still silent under `strict` (`after.party` — not even a well-formed `after.` shape — is accepted undeclared). **`E50-T05` must be re-specified to this list, case-sensitively**; the library matches case-sensitively and so does the hole.
- **House rule A3 is retired.** The `` handler and the `drain_deferred` entry action that used to appear on every transient state are gone — `onUnhandled: "defer"` is the library's own, snapshot-durable buffer. A3 remains in the table above as a historical record; the live rule is this block.

  > **Known inconsistency, tracked as `E50-T09`.** The A3 scaffolding (`_deferred` in `context`, the `"*"` defer handler on entry) is **still present inline in all twenty contracts below**. It was left in place deliberately rather than stripped mechanically, because removing it touches every transient state in the document and must be done alongside the conformance harness (`E50-T03`) so the before/after traces can be proved identical. Until `E50-T09` lands, read the scaffolding as **dead but harmless** — with `onUnhandled: "defer"` set, the runtime holds the event before any `"*"` handler is consulted, so the inline handler never fires. Do **not** copy it into a new machine.

`spawnBlockingTimeout` is carried by every machine for uniformity, and is load-bearing only on the machines that use `spawn_blocking_*`.

Enforcement is CV-LINT-XS1…XS14 in the machine-definition linter (`E29-T10`), plus a runtime assertion in `cv.statechart.factory` — the only place an interpreter may be constructed. Full rationale per key: `docs/research/xstate/17-reeval-0.8.0-verdict.md` §4, as amended by `22-verify-main-verdict.md` §4.5 and `26-verify-3c527b0-verdict.md` §5.6.

> **Verified unchanged on `main` @ `3c527b0` (unreleased 0.8.1, PR #83), 2026-09-18.** **No library default changed on that commit either**, so the six-key block above remains normative **verbatim** — still no edit required, across two verification passes.

> - **Four constraints are added**, all enforced in `cv.statechart`, not in a machine definition. **CV-C19** — never construct `Event(system=True)`, and never trust `is_system_event()` / `Event.system` as a routing or trust boundary: it is a public, user-settable dataclass field that bypasses `strict`, `onUnhandled` and `"*"` (**CV-LINT-XS13**). **CV-C20** — `cv.statechart.persistence` owns the mailbox across a snapshot boundary: quiesce before snapshotting (`queue_depth == 0 and deferred_count == 0`) and reconcile every `pending_invocations()` entry on restore, because the library's snapshot **silently drops** pending `ErrorEvent`/`DoneEvent` and **silently loses** event provenance. **CV-C21** — every `onError` action branches on `isinstance(event, ErrorEvent)` and reads `event.error`; never `.data`, never `event.type.startswith("error.")`, never `event.payload.get(...)` on an error-shaped event (**CV-LINT-XS14**); `escalate` is the exception and still carries its error under `payload["error"]`. **CV-C22** — no global `-W error::DeprecationWarning` in CI while the library trips its own `ErrorEvent.data` deprecation.
> - **CV-C06's `deferred_count` clause is WITHDRAWN AS UNSOUND** — see below.
> - **CV-C15 is re-scoped and narrowed** — see §1.3's event-name bullet.
> - **Capacity planning changes**: an idle invoked child now costs **one** asyncio task, not two (`children + 1`, pinned by the library's own tests). Any budget computed from `2 × children` can be revised.

> **⚠️ The CV-C06 deferred-receipt clause above is withdrawn — it does not work.** Re-tested on `3c527b0`: at the caller's `await` point, `interpreter.deferred_count` reads **`0`** for the deferred case **and** for the genuine no-op. The observation point at which it reads `1` is inside the macrostep, where a caller cannot stand. `test_receipt_is_inconclusive_when_deferred` cannot be written as specified.
>
> **The replacement rule is a prohibition, not a mitigation:** *a `send(wait=True)` receipt reading `changed=False, error=None` is **inadmissible** as a gate on any machine configured `onUnhandled: "defer"` — which is every machine below.* **No order-path statechart ships** until either the library's receipt learns the defer disposition, or `cv.statechart` obtains an out-of-band discriminator (a correlated `on_event_deferred` hook), which the library does not currently expose. Enforced by **CV-LINT-XS9** (re-purposed) and by the absence of an order-path machine in the registry.

> **Verified unchanged on `main` @ `5327ba6` (pre-0.8.1), 2026-09-18.** **No library default changed**, so the six-key block above is normative **verbatim** — no edit was required. Three things did change *around* it, none of them in the machine JSON:
>
> - **Two linter clauses retire.** **CV-LINT-XS9**'s fresh-`Event` rule is gone (the library now detaches the queued envelope, so reusing an `Event` across concurrent `wait=True` sends is safe), and the gateway's duplicate `strict`/`event_schemas` validation is gone (the library now runs it on the calling thread before queuing). Delete both; keep their regression tests.
> - **Three constraints are added**, all enforced outside the machine JSON: **CV-C16** — no action may call `send()` on its own interpreter (use the `raise` built-in; it is the only shape the runaway budget bounds on the async engine), **CV-LINT-XS11**. **CV-C17** — no machine relies on a `raise` chain deeper than 1,000; the cut is silent. **CV-C18** — one `MachineLogic` per `create_machine()` call, one spelling per implementation, `MachineLogic(strict=True)` in the factory, **CV-LINT-XS12**.
> - **CV-C06 gains a clause that changes how callers read a receipt**, not how machines are written: a `send(wait=True)` receipt with `changed=False, error=None` must be treated as **inconclusive** while `interpreter.deferred_count > 0`. With `onUnhandled: "defer"` mandated on every machine below, a legitimate event arriving one microstep early returns a receipt that denies its own transition. Handled once in `cv.statechart`; no per-machine change.

> **Round 14 — verified on tag `v0.9.1` = `45bb7f3`, 2026-09-24. ROW 8. NO NEW MANDATORY KEY; the seven-key block stands.** Round 14 makes four changes.
> 1. **Chart fixes specified and pending merge (Blockers, ours).** The R13-13 (B16 root-hoist to terminal `elevation.dead` plus deletion of `elevated.on.REVOKE`), R13-14 (B18 `onUnhandled:'defer'` plus an ordered unguarded auditing RELEASE fall-through) and R13-15/16 (B11 event-aware guard plus a `degraded.on.GAP_DETECTED` handler) fixes are **re-proven green on 0.9.1 in both spellings**. They are tracked here as *pending merge into the chart JSON*. The charts are not live-order-eligible until they land.
> 2. **B8 (B610-OC-CD03, High, ours).** The naked↔verifying loop trips the chain budget. Add a bounded `verify_attempts` counter in context, guarded, routing to `error` when exhausted.
> 3. **`CV-C68` (new).** Every `events.re_mint()` call goes through `cv_re_mint()` with payload-only overrides. `type=`/`src=` are banned (R14-01).
> 4. **`CV-C65′`/`CV-C66′`.** Shutdown is drain, then journal, then `get_persisted_snapshot()`, then stop. `on_interpreter_start` is permitted for telemetry, branching on `restored_from_snapshot`.

> **Round 13 — verified on tag `v0.9.0` = `91bd979` (tree `main` @ `e3a1f22`), 2026-09-23. NO NEW MANDATORY KEY — the seven-key block stands verbatim. THREE constraints RETIRE (the most in any round), three are new, and the single biggest timing rule in this catalogue is one of the retirements.**
>
> **TIMERS — `CV-C12`, the `after` ban standing since round 4, RETIRES to `CV-C12′`, and the reason is that OUR INSTRUMENT WAS WRONG, not that the library changed.** `bench_c_timers.py` does not reproduce upstream's "N busy machines" loaded-timer scenario at all, so **five consecutive rounds of "174.4 ms against a ≤100 ms bar, still missed" were five rounds of measuring a question nobody asked**, while the largest architectural constraint in this catalogue stood entirely on the number. Re-run on **THEIR** `benchmarks/production_characteristics.py --quick` §2 (`after: 10` lateness at 500 busy machines), ten runs on an idle host: **min 52.1 · p50 53.4 · p99 55.8 · max 55.8 ms — every run under the 100 ms bar, ~44 ms headroom, spread 3.7 ms**, the tightest this programme has recorded. Round 12 read ~110 ms median on the same unchanged tool and three round-13 submissions disagreed with each other (71.0 / 87.5 / 97.9); that resolved to **host load, not library variance**. **`CV-C12′`: `after` and `raise(delay=)` are PERMITTED for coarse timeouts and for deadlines carrying ≥250 ms of tolerance.** Three things do **not** move with it, and the retirement must not be read as a general relaxation: **(1) hard sub-100 ms deadlines and ALL algo timing — TWAP intervals, chase repricing, iceberg release — stay on the external `MonotonicScheduler` with absolute `*_us` deadlines in context, unconditionally.** **(2) The relaxation is CONDITIONAL on re-measuring BENCH-6 on TARGET hardware** (Phase-3 gate P3-G6) — ours is one Windows dev host, and the library's own note says your macrostep cost sets your budget; until that gate is green the linter narrows from "ban `after`" to "ban `after` on any state tagged `x-hard-deadline`" but production keeps the old rule. **(3) `CV-C55` (no `delay` below 10 ms in either spelling) and `R11-W-1` (every chart deadline carries a stable `send_id`) continue to apply to both spellings.**
>
> **ACTIONS — `CV-C64` RETIRES to a lint (`CV-C64′`), and this catalogue again paid nothing for a library change because of a rule it already had.** #225 replaced the inheritable `ContextVar` self-send predicate with **task identity** (`_action_tasks`). The old predicate meant any task spawned inside an action inherited `_ACTIVE_ACTION_OWNER` **for its entire life** and was refused as a self-send even 300 ms after the machine went idle — that inheritance was `CV-C64`'s whole ground, and it is now closed. A worker outliving its action and the documented `asyncio.ensure_future(i.send(..., wait=True))` hand-out are now **ordinary external traffic** (`worker_send='ok'`, machine advances, `chain_trips == 0`), while the **genuine in-step await is still refused by the library** with `ReentrantWaitError`. **No catalogue chart changes behaviour because of #225** — verified positively, not assumed. The prohibition drops to a lint, and the lint **stays**: because the hand-out is legal again, the old blanket ban no longer incidentally catches a *hand-written* reentrant await. **`CV-C25`** (no external `send()` from inside an action — gateway queue only) is **untouched**, and is the rule that made #219 and #225 both cost us nothing.
>
> **NEW: `CV-C67` — register coroutine functions DIRECTLY, never behind a sync `def` wrapper.** This comes from **`R13-21`, a bug in our own harness**, and it is the most instructive thing in the round. Our contract `Stub.mk_a` wrapped every action implementation in a plain `def` for uniformity — correct for sync impls, but for an `async def` action it **drops the returned coroutine**, which is then never awaited and **silently never runs**. No error, no warning, no failed assertion. It had been **masking the #225 probes**, which read `exc=None` where they should have read `ReentrantWaitError`. It surfaced only under `-W error::RuntimeWarning` (`coroutine ... was never awaited`). **Any house action registry must register coroutine functions directly, and the contract runner runs under `-W error::RuntimeWarning` from now on.**
>
> **NEW: `CV-C65` — the shutdown wrapper persists via `get_persisted_snapshot()`, NEVER `drain_pending()`.** From **`R13-01`** (library, High, the single row between us and unconstrained adoption): async `drain_pending()` reads only `_event_queue` and never `_priority_queue`, while the sibling `_snapshot_pending_events()` deliberately includes the lane — two documented durability views of the same interpreter that disagree, with the lossy one being the one whose docstring promises *"every accepted-but-unprocessed event"*. `_teardown()` then clears the lane, so the documented drain → persist → `stop()` recipe **permanently destroys** fired `after` timers, invoke completions and `send_priority()` traffic. Any `drain_pending()` result is a **lower bound**, usable for telemetry only. Enforced by a lint plus a startup assertion, with `tests/xstate_contract/test_shutdown_drain.py` as the passing test row 6 requires.
>
> **NEW: `CV-C66` — no per-process bring-up work may hang off `on_interpreter_start`.** From **`R13-02`**: the hook **never fires on a snapshot-restored interpreter**, on either engine, via either registration route, because both `start()` implementations `return self` from the resume branch above their plugin notification loop. `on_interpreter_stop` still fires, so a lifecycle plugin observes an **unbalanced stop-without-start** — which is a stronger failure mode than an absent hook, because anything holding a span, a correlation id or an audit "actor came up" record either leaks or under-reports. Bring-up happens at construction/restore time in our own wrapper.
>
> **RESTORE — one API change this catalogue must actively adopt (`R13-W1`).** Every restore site passes **`from_snapshot(..., minimum_version=3, plugins=[CvErrorHooks()])`**. Plugins passed via `plugins=` are registered **before** persisted events are admitted; a `.use()` after `from_snapshot` is structurally blind to exactly the strict/schema refusal it exists to catch (a dropped deadline). Verified exactly-once over 320 property cases. **Caveat per `CV-C66`:** this route carries `on_invalid_event` only, never the lifecycle hook. **`CV-C63` NARROWS** — #226 makes `chain_trips` / `last_chain_error` real v3 snapshot fields, so the wrapper no longer carries them in its own envelope; what survives is the **type** rule (`R13-07`): `RestoredError` subclasses `XStateMachineError`, **not** `RunawayChainError`, so a supervisor's `isinstance` check is correct live and **silently false** after a restart — **read `chain_trips > 0`, never `isinstance` the latch.**
>
> **SEVEN CATALOGUE DEFECTS ARE OURS, AND THE ENGINE IS SPEC-CORRECT IN EVERY ONE.** This is the round the board inverted: the library carries 0 Blockers and 1 High; **we** carry 3 Blockers and 1 High, all config-only, all with fixes proven green 11/11 in both spellings on this exact build. **`R13-15` (B11, BLOCKER)** — `degraded.on.STREAM_HEALTHY`'s first arm carries guard `all_streams_healthy` **and** actions `[mark_stream_healthy]` on the same arm; XState v5 and SCXML both evaluate a transition's guard against the context **before that transition's own actions run**, so the guard reads a map in which the very stream the event announces healthy is still `False`, the recovery arm is never selectable, and `unsubscribe_and_flush` never runs. Same class recurs at `recording/degraded REASON_REMOVED`. **Remedy: event-aware guards in our code.** **`R13-16` (B11, HIGH)** — `degraded` defines no `GAP_DETECTED` handler and root `onUnhandled:'defer'` swallows it, so **gap telemetry goes dark precisely during the degraded window** and the operator sees a *healthier* 24 h number the worse the feed gets. **`R13-13` (B16, BLOCKER)** — all four revocation events fail to drop the parallel `elevation` region, and a later `STEP_UP_OK` **re-elevates a revoked session**; the fix needs **both** the root hoist to a terminal `elevation.dead` **and** deletion of the region-level `elevated.on.REVOKE` handler, because the deeper handler outranks the root arm (round-12's correction, re-proven). **`R13-14` (B18, BLOCKER)** — our own opt-in root `onUnhandled:'error'` makes a guard-denied RELEASE **fatal**, and the later authorised RELEASE is then accepted by `send()` but **dropped**: the kill switch is permanently bricked. XState v5 and SCXML treat a guard-denied event as simply untaken and have **no fatal-unhandled mode**, so upstream semantics argue against our configuration. **Fix: `onUnhandled:'defer'` plus an ordered unguarded auditing RELEASE fall-through — the shape B13/B17/B20 already use.** **`R13-17` (B3, MEDIUM)** — `pending.always`'s third arm is **unguarded**, so the leg chart transitions to terminal `leg.error` **during initial entry**, `status=done` before any event is sent. **`R13-18` (B16, MEDIUM)** — the `elevated → elevated` re-enter arm on `STEP_UP_OK` does not audit, so two successful step-ups record one `audit_step_up`. **`R13-19` (B19, MEDIUM)** — `OPERATOR_RESOLVED` is deferred rather than handled in `reconciliation.stale_lockout`, so **an operator cannot clear a stale lockout**.

> **Round 12 — verified on `main` @ `de2da4e` (unreleased 0.8.1, merge of PR #223), 2026-09-23. NO NEW MANDATORY KEY — the seven-key block stands verbatim. Two constraints RETIRE; two are new; the timing rules are the only thing that moves.**
>
> **Gate: ADOPT WITH CONSTRAINTS, decision-table ROW 8** (up two from round 11's row 6; ADR-0016 Amendment 12). All five round-11 fixes (#218–#222) verified FIXED on both engines and both service spellings; library board **0 Blocker · 0 High · 3 Medium · 6 Low**.
>
> **The `strictConfig` key gains its full value this round, and the result is retroactive.** #220 turns the round-11 root-dict scan into a **full recursion** — nested `states`, parallel regions, `on` / `always` / `after` / `onDone` transition bodies, `invoke` entries and their `onDone` / `onError` — with per-level known sets and **path-named findings** (`session.auth: 'entyr' (did you mean 'entry'?)`). Round 11 noted the key's value was "~95 % unrealised until the recursion lands". **It has landed, and all twenty catalogue charts build clean under it — 0 warnings, both lanes.** Both controls are positive: planted nested typos are refused **40/40** with path-named findings, and a full valid-key grammar (including `x-` / `meta` / `description` / `tags` at every level) is accepted with **0** findings. **Therefore: nothing in B1–B20 was ever silently dropping an entry action or a transition.** That could not be established before #220 existed, and it validates every contract result from rounds 4–11. **One hole remains (Q-5): the recursion does not descend into an inline-machine `invoke.src`** — so **CV-C57**, the wrapper's own recursive check, **stands, re-grounded on exactly that hole**. No catalogue chart uses the inline form today.
>
> **TIMERS — the round's only rule change, and it is a RETIREMENT rather than a relaxation.** **CV-C47 and CV-C61 RETIRE.** #218 closes the unbounded `_timer_handles` leak **at the mechanism**: a 200-beat `raise(delay=)` heartbeat holds **peak 1 handle** on every engine/kind cell, a 500× arm/cancel storm peaks at **0** with no double-release, `stop()` releases, and the soak that read **+753 MB** last round reads **RSS Δ 0.00 MB over 93,168 beats** at `handles_max_per_machine = 1`. Both of CV-C47's grounds are now closed — R10-03 by #212, R11-04 by #218 — and a constraint with no surviving ground is rot, not a safety margin. **But three things do NOT move, and the retirement must not be read as a general relaxation:**
>
> 1. **CV-C12 STANDS UNCHANGED — `after` (and now `raise(delay=)`, which #212 made its equal) is permitted ONLY for coarse, non-critical timeouts where seconds of lateness is tolerable.** Its ground is **BENCH-6**, last measured at **174.4 ms against a ≤100 ms bar** and now **UNMEASURED FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE ROUNDS**. #218 fixed a handle-**retention** defect and says nothing about **drift under load**; retiring CV-C12 on its strength would answer a timing question with a memory measurement. **All algo timing — TWAP intervals, chase repricing, iceberg release — stays on the external `MonotonicScheduler` with absolute `*_us` deadlines in context.**
> 2. **`raise(delay=)` is not thereby recommended**, merely no longer separately banned. **Nothing becomes newly legal for algo timing.**
> 3. **CV-C55** (no `delay` below 10 ms in either spelling) and **R11-W-1** (every chart deadline carries a **stable `send_id`**) continue to apply to both spellings. The `_timer_handles` gauge **survives CV-C61's retirement as telemetry** — it is the instrument that would detect a recurrence.
>
> **ACTIONS — a BREAKING CHANGE upstream that cost this catalogue nothing, and the reason it cost nothing is a rule we already had.** #219 makes an action that awaits `send(..., wait=True)` on its **own** interpreter raise `ReentrantWaitError` instead of deadlocking (the sync engine refuses the same shape for parity). **Zero catalogue actions required a change — verified positively, not assumed:** 0 of 573 corpus scripts and 0 of 20 charts contain the shape. That is **CV-C25** (no external `send()` from inside an action — gateway queue only) doing its job since round 5. **NEW CV-C64** makes the audit standing and widens it: the **documented escape hatch** `asyncio.ensure_future(i.send(..., wait=True))` is **also unsafe** (DE-L1) — the guard rides an **inheritable `ContextVar`**, so a task spawned inside an action keeps `_ACTIVE_ACTION_OWNER` for its whole life and is refused even 300 ms after the machine goes idle. A helper that must talk to the machine goes through the **gateway queue**, or is spawned with a **fresh `contextvars.Context()`**. A **`def`** action calling `send(wait=True)` gets an unawaited `_Awaitable` — no error, no warning, no receipt — so **the lint covers both kinds, and it must run BEFORE the dependency bump.**
>
> **SUPERVISION — #222 gives us the API CV-C59 asked for, plus one durability gap that is ours.** `last_error` remains the **per-step** read it always was (by design); chain stickiness now lives in `interpreter.chain_trips`, the `interpreter.last_chain_error` latch, `clear_chain_error()` and `PluginBase.on_chain_budget_exceeded` (fires exactly once per trip, settle-budget trips included; `on_event_dropped(reason='chain_budget')` **precedes** it, so either is safe to key a supervisor on). **`chain_trips == 0` on every happy path across all twenty charts, both lanes.** **NEW CV-C63:** the latch is **process-local — not a snapshot field** — so read `chain_trips` and `last_chain_error` **before** `get_persisted_snapshot()` and carry them in the wrapper's own envelope, or a restart silently resets "this machine discarded work" to zero.
>
> **PERSISTENCE — one re-label that matters.** `minimum_version=3` (CV-C52) is **HYGIENE, NOT A SECURITY CONTROL**: R12-02 demonstrates it by refusing a forged `"version": 2` blob while leaving an equivalent **v3 verbatim write** untouched — both reach the same state. **The boundary is CV-C53, the MAC'd journal at rest.** `from_snapshot` documents the snapshot as **trusted input** and `machine_hash` as *"a fingerprint, not a MAC"*. **CV-C49′** (never re-persist an un-`start()`ed interpreter) is **retained as defence in depth** even though #221 closed its ground at 640/640 byte-identical records across four compaction hops.

> **OUR OUTSTANDING CATALOGUE DEFECTS — all config-only, and now the ONLY things blocking the order path.** Ticketed in **E50-T43**.
>
> - **R12-13 (B16, Blocker, open SEVEN rounds)** — elevation outlives the session. `LOGOUT` / `IDLE_DEADLINE` / `ABSOLUTE_DEADLINE` leave `["session.auth.revoked", "session.elevation.elevated"]`, and `REVOKE` lands in `normal` where a later `STEP_UP_OK` **re-elevates a dead session**. 12/12 lanes fail across both engines, both spellings and four kill events. **CORRECTION TO THE PRESCRIBED FIX, recorded because it would otherwise ship wrong: the root hoist to a final `elevation.dead` state fixes only 9 of 12 lanes, because the deeper `elevated.on.REVOKE` handler OUTRANKS the root arm. The region-level `REVOKE` handler must ALSO be deleted.**
> - **R12-14 (B18, Blocker, open SEVEN rounds)** — one **guard-denied** `RELEASE` under root `onUnhandled: "error"` makes the machine fatal (`status='error'`), and the subsequent **authorised** `RELEASE` is accepted by `send()` but **silently dropped**: `bricked: true`. The Amendment-6 removal of `onUnhandled: "error"` from B18 **still has not landed in `ka_killswitch`**. Fix: `onUnhandled: "defer"` plus an ordered **unguarded auditing `RELEASE` fall-through** — proven 6/6 and 13/13 on both engines and both spellings.
> - **R12-15 (B19, High)** — `stale_lockout.on` has only `RECONNECTED` while `divergent` carries an `OPERATOR_RESOLVED` arm, so under `onUnhandled: "defer"` the operator event **parks forever** and a venue that never reconnects leaves the account `account_locked` / `critical` **until process restart**. Fix verified in both lanes: add `stale_lockout.on.OPERATOR_RESOLVED → idle` with `unlock_account`.
> - **A general rule falls out of R12-14 and R12-15 together, and it belongs in every control chart's review:** `onUnhandled: "error"` **bricks** on a guard denial, and `onUnhandled: "defer"` **parks forever** on a missing arm. Neither policy is free. **Every operator-recovery event must have an arm in EVERY state it must be honoured in**, and every state whose only arm is guarded needs an **ordered unguarded fallback**.

> **The other six keys are normative VERBATIM — no edit required for an eleventh round.** No library default changed at this commit. What changed is the *justification* behind three annotations, and per ADR-0016 Amendment 11 / standing amendment 20 a constraint carried on a dead justification is folklore, so each is restated:
>
> - **`strict: true` — the annotation changes, the value does not. `strict` IS NOT AND NEVER WAS A SNAPSHOT BOUNDARY.** Two Blocker/High findings were filed this round against restore-path provenance (the `"version": 2` downgrade minting `engine: true`; `scheduled_sends` bypassing the strict check) and **both were refuted on controls**: an attacker who can write the blob reaches the same target state via `state_ids`/`context` **with no event forgery at all**. `from_snapshot` is a **documented trusted-input boundary** (#205 applies `state_ids`/`configuration`/`context` verbatim; `machine_hash` is explicitly *not a MAC*). **The boundary is the HMAC tag our envelope writes over the whole blob (CV-C53)** — not `strict`, not `minimum_version`. Residual R11-02 (Low): `scheduled_sends` restores without the *reported* refusal #214 promises, so a chart upgrade that undeclares an event yields silent delivery → **CV-C54** (reconcile persisted vs admitted record counts).
> - **`maxIterations: 500` — three notes, all new. (a) It NEVER bounded delayed work, on any commit.** #212 gives `raise(delay=)` the same exemption `after` always had; our own claim that this was an escape hatch was **refuted** on an `after:` control behaving identically at the same delays. Do **not** treat `maxIterations` as a liveness bound for anything timer-driven. **(b) TWO PLATEAUS, both correct:** descent-seeded chains get `maxIterations+3`, externally kicked ones exactly `+2` (swept over limits {3,5,7,9}). Sizing against the external number **under-provisions the descent case by ~2.7×** → **CV-C62**. **(c) A trip is ERASED by the next event:** `last_error` is a per-event read, not a latch, so one benign handled event clears `RunawayChainError`, and `interpreter.error` is never set at all. On a permanently inert machine, 6/40 (`def`) and 8/40 (`async`) post-mortems read perfectly healthy → **CV-C59**, never poll `last_error` for chain health.
> - **`actionErrorPolicy: "rollback"` — unchanged, and the attempt counter is re-confirmed as mandatory.** Re-measured at this commit: the mandated rollback+onDone storm places `place_order` **128× (async) / 91× (def)** on B1 and `submit_child` **208× / 126×** on B5 before the chain cut. Library-correct behaviour; **an idempotency key on every order-placing service, keyed on CHART STATE and never on lap, remains non-negotiable.**
>
> **TIMERS — the round's central rule, and it TIGHTENS rather than relaxes.** #212 made a self-paced `raise(delay=)` heartbeat *legal*, and the same reversal made it *leak*: **`_timer_handles` retains exactly 1.00 handle per beat, for ever**, on both engines and both action kinds (**+455 MB / 24 s at 200 machines, strictly linear, no plateau**), because the handle is keyed under the machine id while the only pruner pops by state id on state exit. **No usage bounds it** — id reuse, explicit `cancel(sendId)` before re-arm, a 250 ms period and a never-exiting self-loop all measure 1.00/beat. The `after:` spelling is **flat**. Therefore **CV-C61**, a three-way split:
>
> 1. **restart-critical deadlines → `raise(delay=)`**, with a **stable `send_id`**, on a machine with a **bounded interpreter lifetime**, with `len(i._timer_handles.get(i.id, []))` exported as a gauge and alerted;
> 2. **everything periodic and non-persistent → `after:`**;
> 3. **NO high-frequency `raise(delay=)` heartbeat under any circumstances** (**CV-C47**, which stands, is widened, and is now **load-bearing** — its original R10-03 ground was closed by #212 and R11-04 replaced it).
>
> **No `delay` below 10 ms anywhere, either spelling (CV-C55)** — `delay` is milliseconds and the Windows clock floor is ~15.6 ms.
>
> **CV-C12 STANDS UNCHANGED: `after` remains BANNED in catalogue machines.** #212 did not touch `after`'s drift; **BENCH-6 is not merely still missed (174.4 ms vs ≤100 ms) but UNMEASURED FOR FOUR ROUNDS**, and a constraint whose ground has not been re-measured cannot be retired. All algo timing stays on the external `MonotonicScheduler` with absolute `*_us` deadlines in context.
>
> **K11 — the tension this catalogue must resolve, and it is currently blocked upstream.** All 20 machines below declare **zero `after` transitions and zero `raise(delay=)` actions**; every deadline is a host-side timer an action stamps. #213 exists precisely to make deadlines restart-safe, and **we cannot use it until deadlines move into the charts** — which would adopt the leaking primitive as a production dependency, since `after` deadlines are deliberately not persisted (#128, R11-DC-2). **Do not move catalogue deadlines into the charts until R11-04 is fixed upstream** (E50-R11-11). The containment above is free only while K11 holds.
>
> **Three further catalogue lints, all cheap and all currently unwritten:** every chart deadline declares a **stable `send_id`** (#213 keys `scheduled_sends` by it; an auto-generated id leaves a restored deadline unaddressable) · **never register a user action whose name collides with a built-in** (`raise`, `send`, …) — a collision **silently disarms the built-in**: `beats=0`, `last_error=None`, no warning, no error; filter registrations through `xstate_statemachine.actions.is_builtin` · **`SimulatedClock` fires neither `after` nor restored `scheduled_sends`** on this build, so every deadline property must be verified against the **real** clock (the real-clock property verified 300/300).
>
> **Two runtime rules that are not machine-JSON but bind every machine below.** **CV-C51:** no entry or exit action may `await` a receipt (`send(..., wait=True)`) on its own interpreter, directly or through a helper — #215's `_descent_done` gate makes that cycle unsatisfiable and **`start()` hangs forever** with `last_error=None`, status `running` and a legal configuration. **CV-C56:** every `start()` is wrapped in `asyncio.wait_for(..., CV_START_TIMEOUT)` and a timeout is a **hard startup failure, never a retry** — it is the only detector we have for that hang.
>
> **CV-C48 RETIRES** (its ground, the 0.8.0-era `after`-record migration cliff, is closed by #214's v2 upcast, and the security objection to that upcast was refuted). **CV-C45's stripping clause RETIRES** with it, replaced by **CV-C45″ / CV-C60**: read `last_error` / `last_transition_ok` **immediately after `from_snapshot` and before `start()`** — `on_invalid_event` is **structurally unreachable** on the restore path (`from_snapshot` takes no `plugins=` and is still constructing the interpreter), and `last_error` holds only the **last** refusal and reverts to `None` after `start()`. **CV-C49 is REWRITTEN** as **CV-C49′**: #213 now persists the armed-delay debt exactly (600/600), so the rule becomes **never re-persist an interpreter that has not been `start()`ed** — the restored records sit in `_restored_self_sends` until `start()` consumes them while `_persist_scheduled_sends` reads only `_armed_self_sends`, so a journal-compaction or migration job that loads and re-writes **without starting destroys every deadline, silently** (R11-08, **CV-C58**).

### 1.3c The FINAL mandatory machine configuration (2026-09-24, ADR-0016 Decision (final))

Supersedes the interpreter-side guidance in §1.3b's amendment notes. The chart-side keys of §1.3b stand, with root `"onUnhandled": "defer"` (+ an ordered unguarded audit arm wherever a guarded transition may be denied) and `"maxIterations": 500` (CV-C62). The interpreter side is exactly this, and lives only in `cv.statechart.factory` (source: `docs/research/xstate/79-r14-final-readiness-verdict.md` §7):

```python
machine = create_machine(chart, logic=logic, strict_config=True)
interpreter = Interpreter(
    machine, strict=True, event_schemas=CV_EVENT_SCHEMAS,
    max_queue_size=CV_INBOX_BOUND,     # async only; SyncInterpreter(max_queue_size=...) -> ValueError (#245)
    overflow_policy="refuse",
).use(CvErrorHooks())
# chart root: "onUnhandled": "defer" (+ ordered unguarded audit arm), "maxIterations": 500 (CV-C62)

# restore
interpreter = Interpreter.from_snapshot(machine, blob, minimum_version=3,
                                        plugins=[CvErrorHooks()])   # kwarg, not .use() (R13-W1)
assert interpreter.last_transition_ok is not None                    # before start() (CV-C60)
_cv_bring_up(interpreter)                                            # CV-C66'
await interpreter.start()   # on_interpreter_start fires; branch on restored_from_snapshot

# supervision
if interpreter.chain_trips > 0: page_operator(interpreter.last_chain_error)
if interpreter.dropped_receipts > 0: alert("receipt dropped")        # CV-C69

# shutdown (CV-C65')
drained = await interpreter.drain_pending()     # [priority..., inbox...]
journal(drained)                                # replay exactly once after restore
blob = interpreter.get_persisted_snapshot()
await interpreter.stop()

# provenance (CV-C68)
ev2 = cv_re_mint(ev, data=patched)              # never type=/src=
# timing: after:/raise(delay=) coarse only, >=250 ms tolerance, >=10 ms (CV-C12', CV-C55)
# actions: coroutine functions directly (CV-C67); no external send() in actions (CV-C25)
```

Standing constraints and their enforcement are tabled in ADR-0016 § *Decision (final)*.

### 1.4 How to read each entry

Every entry has the same seven parts: **Purpose** · **Why this shape** · **Contract (JSON)** · **States** · **Events** · **Guards / Actions / Services** · **Invariants**. The JSON is the normative part; the tables are derived from it and exist for review, not as a second source of truth.

### 1.5 Conventions

- Targets are written absolutely in the JSON (`#order.lifecycle.filled`) and abbreviated in the tables (`lifecycle.filled`) for width.
- `_fault` and `*_us` are reserved context keys with fixed meanings: the fault record (A1 / MUST-01) and an absolute microsecond deadline (A2). `_deferred` is **retired** — the deferral buffer is now owned by the runtime under `onUnhandled: "defer"` and is observable as `interpreter.deferred_count`, not as a context key (§1.3b).
- `(always)` in an event column is an eventless transition, evaluated on entry to the state.
- `*` is the wildcard handler; in this catalogue it is always `defer`.

## B1 — Order

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `order` |
| **Root type** | `parallel` (orthogonal regions) |
| **Owning epic** | E29 - OMS core & order state machine |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §8.2 (order state machine), §8.8 (native-SL invariant), ADR-0006 |
| **Fit (research)** | Good |
| **Event rate** | per-order exchange events; bursty on fills, otherwise low |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 20 / 18 / 4 |

**Purpose.** The canonical lifecycle of a single exchange order, from local draft to a terminal state, plus the independent native-stop-loss protection invariant for the position that order opens.

**Why this shape.** Two orthogonal regions. `lifecycle` carries the S1-S9 machine from 24 §8.2; `protection` independently tracks the §8.8 native-SL invariant, so an order can be `partially_filled` **and** `sl_missing` at the same time - a combination the current single-enum `status` column cannot express, and which is exactly what the §8.8 watchdog must observe. `quarantined` is the fourteenth lifecycle state and exists solely as the landing state for a faulted action (A1 / MUST-01).

### B1.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `adopt_ack` |
| `adopt_amend` |
| `adopt_cancel_ack` |
| `adopt_recon` |
| `apply_fill` |
| `arm_recon_deadline` |
| `arm_sl_deadline` |
| `bump_recon_misses` |
| `defer` |
| `emit_terminal` |
| `keep_prior_order_live` |
| `map_reject_code` |
| `mark_needs_lookup` |
| `notify_amend_rejected` |
| `notify_protection_region` |
| `persist_event` |
| `raise_critical_alert` |
| `raise_naked_position_alert` |
| `raise_unknown_alert` |
| `record_transport_fault` |
| `request_fallback_sl` |
| `request_reconciliation` |
| `reserve_rate_token` |
| `set_local_reject` |
| `set_reject_unresolvable` |
| `stamp_validated` |

### B1.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-1** | `filled_qty <= qty` at every observable point, including mid-drain. |
| **INV-2** | A terminal state (`filled`, `cancelled`, `rejected`, `expired`) is never left (24 §8.2 S6). |
| **INV-5** | **No delivered `EXEC` is ever unaccounted for**: every `exec_id` the gateway delivers appears in `seen_exec_ids` or in `_deferred`. This is the direct regression test for LC-03 and it is mandatory for this family. |
| **INV-B1-a** | `apply_fill` is order-independent: applying the same set of `EXEC` events in any order yields identical `filled_qty` and `avg_price` (MUSTNOT-04). |
| **INV-B1-b** | `exec_id` dedupe is total - a repeated `exec_id` changes nothing (24 §8.2 S4). |
| **INV-B1-c** | An `AMEND_REJECTED` leaves the prior order live (S2): the machine returns to the state it amended from, never to a terminal state. |
| **INV-B1-d** | A fill beats a pending cancel (S3): `cancel_pending` handles `EXEC` explicitly rather than deferring it. |
| **INV-B1-e** | `unknown` never resubmits (S1); it may only be resolved by a `RECON_FOUND_*` event. |
| **INV-B1-f** | The `protection` region reaches `sl_present` only from an exchange read (`SL_OBSERVED`), never from a local assumption. |
| **INV-B1-g** | A write-ahead `order_events` row exists for every transition before the in-memory state changes (S8, A7, MUST-02). |

### B1.8 Implementation notes

- **Deferral is load-bearing.** `submitting` and `amend_pending` are occupied while an exchange round trip is in flight. Omit the wildcard handler on one of them and a fill is lost with no exception and no log line (LC-03; Study 05 C17 lost three `PARTIAL` fills deterministically across 10 runs). `cancel_pending` deliberately handles `EXEC` explicitly instead of deferring, because S3 says the fill wins the race.
- **Timing is external.** `sl_deadline_us` and the reconciliation deadline are absolute microsecond timestamps in context, armed by the `MonotonicScheduler` and re-armed on restore (A2).
- **Restore re-drives invokes.** A crash in `submitting` restores a machine parked in `submitting` with no service running (LC-19); the boot procedure re-sends the triggering event *after* draining `_deferred` (MUST-03).

## B2 — TradeGroup

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `trade_group` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `draft` |
| **Owning epic** | E34 - Trade-group fan-out & rate-limit governor |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §9.6 (group lifecycle), §9.4 (fan-out), §9.5 (leg failure policy), ADR-0008 |
| **Fit (research)** | Good |
| **Event rate** | low - one event per leg outcome |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 10 / 10 / 3 |

**Purpose.** The supervisor for one fan-out: it spawns one leg per account, aggregates leg outcomes into a group status, and runs the compensating unwind when policy demands it.

**Why this shape.** The group is a pure aggregator. Group status is a **function of the leg counters in context**, never of event arrival order - `EVALUATE` is raised after each leg outcome to re-run the decision, because an `always` self-target on `submitting` would deadlock (LC-02) and because `raise` is queued behind pending external events rather than settling inside the macrostep (LC-05), so `EVALUATE` may be observed *after* a later `LEG_OPEN`.

### B2.4 Invoked services

| In state | `id` | `src` | `onDone` | `onError` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `unwinding` | `unwind` | `unwind_machine` | `failed` if `unwind_complete`; `failed` | `failed` |

### B2.5 Guards

| Guard | Polarity | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `all_non_skipped_open` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `policy_all_or_none_and_any_failed` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `policy_is_abort_on_first` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `quiesced_and_some_open` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `quiesced_and_zero_open` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `some_open` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `unwind_complete` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |

### B2.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `arm_quiesce_deadline` |
| `count_failed` |
| `count_open` |
| `count_skipped` |
| `force_resolve_unknown_legs` |
| `mark_quiesced` |
| `mark_unwind_incomplete` |
| `mark_unwound` |
| `persist_unwind_plan` |
| `raise_critical_alert` |
| `raise` → `EVALUATE` (built-in) |
| `reserve_rate_budget` |
| `launch_all_legs` |
| `stop_submitting_remaining_legs` |

### B2.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-4** | The sum of leg `filled_qty` equals the group aggregate at every quiescent point. |
| **INV-B2-a** | Group status is a **pure function of `legs_open`/`legs_failed`/`legs_skipped`/`legs_total`**; no guard reads the event. |
| **INV-B2-b** | `legs_open + legs_failed + legs_skipped <= legs_total` always; a resolution state is entered only once that sum equals `legs_total` or the quiesce deadline fires. |
| **INV-B2-c** | `all_or_none` never rests in `partially_open`: it either reaches `open` or runs the unwind. |
| **INV-B2-d** | The unwind is restartable and idempotent - re-entering `unwinding` after a crash re-drives the same persisted plan without double-closing. |
| **INV-B2-e** | Legs are addressed through the application-owned registry, never by `sendTo` service key (LC-16). |

### B2.8 Implementation notes

- **MUSTNOT-02 applies here specifically.** `reserve_rate_budget` on `submitting` is an *action that calls* the synchronous token-bucket governor. The governor itself is never a statechart: measured p50 35.2 ms per account as a chart against 0.148 us as a token bucket (~238,000x), and a 5-account atomic fan-out would burn ~175 ms of the 750 ms `CV_FANOUT_ADMIT_WAIT_MS` budget purely asking permission.
- **Bound the actors.** MUSTNOT-08 caps concurrently invoked children at 200 per process; each costs two asyncio tasks, one polling at 200 Hz.

## B3 — TradeGroupLeg

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `leg` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `pending` |
| **Owning epic** | E34 - Trade-group fan-out & rate-limit governor |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §9.1 (model), §9.5.1 (per-account unwind), §9.3 (sizing) |
| **Fit (research)** | Good |
| **Event rate** | low per leg; bursty on fills |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 16 / 15 / 4 |

**Purpose.** One account's share of a fan-out: preflight, sizing from the per-account profile, entry submission, TP ladder, and the nested compensating unwind.

**Why this shape.** The unwind is a **nested compound state**, not a flag: `cancel_children -> close_position -> verify_flat -> verify_sl`. 24 §9.5.1 already describes it as "an explicit, restartable, idempotent state machine rather than 'cancel and close'", and there is currently no ticket anywhere in the backlog that builds it.

### B3.5 Guards

| Guard | Polarity | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `close_attempts_left` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `fully_filled` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `is_flat` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `lookup_says_filled` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `lookup_says_live` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `passes_preflight` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `should_skip` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |

### B3.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `accumulate_fill` |
| `arm_submit_timeout` |
| `bump_close_attempts` |
| `defer` |
| `map_error` |
| `mark_incomplete` |
| `note_cancel_failure` |
| `place_tp_ladder_once` |
| `raise_naked_position_alert` |
| `read_authoritative_position_qty` |
| `size_from_profile` |
| `submit_entry_order` |

### B3.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B3-a** | `sized_qty` is computed exactly once, from the profile snapshot taken at `pending`; a profile edit mid-fan-out never changes an in-flight leg. |
| **INV-B3-b** | `place_tp_ladder_once` is idempotent - re-entering `open` after a restore does not create a second ladder. |
| **INV-B3-c** | `verify_flat` reads the **authoritative exchange position**, never local state; `qty_drift` is recorded, not assumed zero. |
| **INV-B3-d** | `verify_sl` runs after every close attempt: a leg may not leave the unwind while a position with no native SL exists (C-2.6). |
| **INV-B3-e** | `close_attempts` is bounded; exhaustion reaches `error`, which is a **visible** state, not a retry loop. |
| **INV-5** | No delivered `EXEC` is unaccounted for across `submitting`, `resolving` and the unwind. |

### B3.8 Implementation notes

- `resolving` exists for the `ORDER_UNKNOWN` case and resolves by `orderLinkId` lookup (C-2.10), never by blind resubmission.
- Retry loops route through a distinct intermediate state rather than an `always` self-target (A4 / LC-02).

## B4 — EmulatedAlgo - OCO

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `oco` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `arming` |
| **Owning epic** | E33 - Emulated algos (OCO, iceberg, TWAP, chase) |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §10.2 (OCO), §10.1 (common algo model) |
| **Fit (research)** | Good - the best algo fit; event-driven and timing-light |
| **Event rate** | low |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 11 / 11 / 3 |

**Purpose.** One-cancels-other: two child orders race, the winner settles and the loser is cancelled, with an explicit overshoot path for the double-fill case.

**Why this shape.** `overshoot` is a **named state**, not an error branch. A genuine double fill (both legs filling before either cancel lands) is a real market outcome; it must be visible, journalled and corrected by a reduce-only market order - not swallowed.

### B4.5 Guards

| Guard | Polarity | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `cancel_on_position_flat` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |

### B4.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `bump_settle_failures` |
| `defer` |
| `journal_double_fill` |
| `map_error` |
| `raise_critical_alert` |
| `raise_warning_alert` |
| `record_child_ids` |
| `record_fill_a` |
| `record_fill_b` |

### B4.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B4-a** | `filled_a` and `filled_b` are both recorded before any settlement decision; the machine never assumes a single winner. |
| **INV-B4-b** | Reaching `completed` implies both children are terminal (`CHILDREN_TERMINAL` observed), never merely 'cancel requested'. |
| **INV-B4-c** | `reduce_only_market_excess` is reduce-only by construction; the overshoot correction can never open a position. |
| **INV-B4-d** | A fill on the other leg **during settlement** is applied, not dropped - this is what the wildcard deferral on the settling states buys (E33-S01 acceptance). |

### B4.8 Implementation notes

- Timing-light: no in-machine timers at all, which is why this rates the cleanest of the four algos.

## B5 — EmulatedAlgo - Iceberg

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `iceberg` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `pending` |
| **Owning epic** | E33 - Emulated algos (OCO, iceberg, TWAP, chase) |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §10.3 (iceberg), §10.1 |
| **Fit (research)** | Workaround - structure and bounds only; all timing external |
| **Event rate** | low |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 13 / 13 / 3 |

**Purpose.** Slice a large order into visible child slices, refilling as each slice completes, with post-only reject handling and a cooldown.

**Why this shape.** Slice counting routes through distinct states (`submitting_slice -> working -> waiting_refill -> submitting_slice`) rather than an accumulate-until-threshold `always` self-target, which deadlocks (LC-02; probe A10 parked at `loop` with `n==1`, `is_running == True` and no error, while A19 proved the distinct-intermediate-state form converges).

### B5.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B5-a** | The sum of submitted slice quantities is `<= total_qty`; `remaining_qty` is never negative. |
| **INV-B5-b** | At most one child slice is live at a time (`active_child_id` is single-valued). |
| **INV-B5-c** | `slices_done <= max_slices`; exhaustion reaches a completion path, never an unbounded loop. |
| **INV-B5-d** | `next_refill_at_us` and the cooldown deadline are absolute timestamps in context, re-armed from context on restore - including the 'deadline expired while the process was down' case. |
| **INV-B5-e** | Two consecutive post-only rejects force `cooling_down`; the machine never busy-loops against a crossed book. |

### B5.8 Implementation notes

- `WS_DISCONNECT` is policy-driven via `on_disconnect_is_freeze`: freeze-and-pause or cancel, per the algo's configured disconnect policy (24 §10.1).

## B6 — EmulatedAlgo - TWAP

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `twap` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `pending` |
| **Owning epic** | E33 - Emulated algos (OCO, iceberg, TWAP, chase) |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §10.4 (TWAP), §10.1 |
| **Fit (research)** | Workaround - structure and bounds only; all timing external |
| **Event rate** | low |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 12 / 12 / 3 |

**Purpose.** Spread an order across a duration in slices, with a participation cap, a price limit, catch-up for missed slices and a final sweep.

**Why this shape.** Every slice boundary is precomputed as an **absolute deadline list in context** (`slice_deadlines_us`) and registered with the external `MonotonicScheduler` on arming. Nothing here uses `after`: measured, a 10 ms `after` fires 2.25 s late under 500 busy interpreters, and pending timers do not survive `from_snapshot` (LC-20, LC-26).

### B6.5 Guards

| Guard | Polarity | Contract |

### B6.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `apply_catch_up` |
| `bump_failure` |
| `bump_slices_done` |
| `compute_slice_qty_with_participation_cap` |
| `defer` |
| `precompute_all_slice_deadlines` |
| `raise_price_limit_notice` |
| `raise_warning_alert` |
| `rearm_deadlines_from_context` |
| `record_child` |
| `record_shortfall` |
| `register_deadlines_with_scheduler` |

### B6.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B6-a** | `slices_done <= slices_total`, and submitted quantity plus `shortfall_qty` equals `total_qty` at completion. |
| **INV-B6-b** | `rearm_deadlines_from_context` is the only way deadlines come back after a restore; deadlines that expired during downtime are resolved by catch-up, not silently skipped. |
| **INV-B6-c** | A slice below the instrument minimum rolls forward into the next slice rather than being submitted or dropped. |
| **INV-B6-d** | `price_blocked` is a **state**, not a skipped slice: time spent blocked is visible and recorded as shortfall. |
| **INV-B6-e** | Slice-interval error p95 `<= 100 ms` with 500 resident order machines (E33-S03 acceptance). |

## B7 — EmulatedAlgo - Chase

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `chase` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `arming` |
| **Owning epic** | E33 - Emulated algos (OCO, iceberg, TWAP, chase) |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §10.5 (chase / pegged limit), §10.1 |
| **Fit (research)** | Workaround - the weakest of the four algos |
| **Event rate** | input bounded to <= 10 Hz by contract |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 13 / 13 / 3 |

**Purpose.** A pegged limit order that reprices toward a moving book target, bounded in ticks, repricings and wall-clock time.

**Why this shape.** The reprice interval is a **monotonic guard over `last_reprice_us`**, not a timer: `drift_over_threshold_and_interval_elapsed_and_budget_ok` is a pure predicate over context and the incoming target. The 200 ms nominal interval has no timing headroom on Windows (measured ~10.9 ms drift on a 5 ms sleep with an idle loop - the ~15.6 ms platform timer floor showing through), so an `after`-based design is not viable.

### B7.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B7-a** | `repricings <= max_repricings` and cumulative movement `<= max_chase_ticks`; exceeding either reaches `bound_exceeded`, a visible state. |
| **INV-B7-b** | `compute_target_excluding_own_size` never chases the algo's own resting order. |
| **INV-B7-c** | A reprice is attempted only when the rate budget permits it; `RATE_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` parks the algo rather than queueing amendments. |
| **INV-B7-d** | `BOOK_TARGET_MOVED` is an **edge-triggered, pre-decimated** input at `<= 10 Hz` produced by a plain-Python `ChaseTargetTracker`. Raw book deltas never reach this machine (MUSTNOT-01/03; E33-S04/Q03 assert the bound). |
| **INV-B7-e** | `timing_out` resolves by policy to cancel or market conversion; it never silently leaves a resting order. |

### B7.8 Implementation notes

- This is the machine most at risk of being level-triggered by accident. The tracker is the boundary: it does the fast work in plain Python and emits a bounded event stream.

## B8 — Position protection / native-SL invariant

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `position_protection` |
| **Root type** | `parallel` (orthogonal regions) |
| **Owning epic** | E32 - Brackets, scaled orders & native SL invariant |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §8.8 (safety invariant), §10.7 (bracket), ADR-0008 rule 2 |
| **Fit (research)** | Workaround |
| **Event rate** | low; the watchdog scan is externally scheduled |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 11 / 9 / 0 |

**Purpose.** Enforce C-2.6: every open position carries a native exchange-side stop-loss, with an independent watchdog region that keeps checking.

**Why this shape.** Two parallel regions. `sl` is the attach/verify/protect path; `watchdog` scans independently, so a position cannot be considered protected merely because the attach path believed it was. **`protected` is reachable only from an exchange read** (`read_position_sl` reporting an SL), never from a successful attach call alone.

### B8.4 Invoked services

| In state | `id` | `src` | `onDone` | `onError` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sl.attaching` | `att` | `attach_native_sl` | `sl.verifying` | `sl.attaching` if `attach_attempts_left`; `sl.naked` |
| `sl.verifying` | `ver` | `read_position_sl` | `sl.protected` if `exchange_reports_sl`; `sl.naked` if `fallback_attempts_left`; `sl.naked_unrecoverable` | `sl.naked` if `fallback_attempts_left`; `sl.naked_unrecoverable` |

| `sl.naked` | `fb` | `attach_fallback_sl` | `sl.verifying` | `sl.naked_unrecoverable` |

### B8.5 Guards

| Guard | Polarity | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `attach_attempts_left` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `exchange_reports_sl` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `explicit_audited_override` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `fallback_attempts_left` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | `context.fallback_attempts < CV_B8_MAX_FALLBACK` (default 3); no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error (fails toward `naked_unrecoverable`, which pages) |
| `sl_observed` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `tightens_only` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |

### B8.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `arm_sl_deadline` |
| `bump_attach_attempts` |
| `bump_fallback_attempts` |
| `bump_miss_counter` |
| `consider_reduce_only_close` |
| `defer` |
| `emit_naked_metric` |
| `maybe_raise_watchdog_miss` |
| `page_owner` |
| `raise_critical_alert` |
| `reset_fallback_attempts` |
| `reset_miss_counter` |
| `stamp_naked_since` |

### B8.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-3** | No position is in `naked` for longer than `sl_deadline_us` without a P1 alert (principle P4). |
| **INV-B8-a** | `protected` implies a completed exchange read reported an SL. An attach `onDone` alone moves to `verifying`, never to `protected`. |
| **INV-B8-b** | `tightens_only` is a **deny-polarity** guard (A6): if it raises or cannot decide, the amendment is blocked. |
| **INV-B8-c** | Loosening an SL requires `explicit_audited_override` and writes an audit record (C-2.9). |
| **INV-B8-d** | `naked_unrecoverable` pages the owner and considers a reduce-only close. No configuration, flag or environment suppresses this (C-2.6). |
| **INV-B8-e** | The watchdog region's miss counter is reset only by a positive `sl_observed`, never by the passage of time. |
| **INV-B8-f** | *(2026-09-24, B610-OC-CD03 fix)* The `naked ⇄ verifying` loop is bounded: `fallback_attempts` is bumped on every `naked` entry and reset only on `protected` entry; once `fallback_attempts_left` is false, verification failure goes to `naked_unrecoverable` (pages). Contract test: a fallback attach that succeeds while the exchange never reports an SL reaches `naked_unrecoverable` in ≤ `CV_B8_MAX_FALLBACK` laps with `chain_trips == 0` and exactly that many `raise_critical_alert` firings. |

### B8.8 Implementation notes

- **Corrected 2026-09-24 (B610-OC-CD03, High, ours):** added `fallback_attempts` context, `fallback_attempts_left` guard, `bump_fallback_attempts` on `naked` entry and `reset_fallback_attempts` on `protected` entry; `verifying` failure falls through to `naked_unrecoverable` once exhausted. Before the fix, a successful-but-useless fallback attach looped `naked ⇄ verifying` unbounded (≈500 laps/s, one P1 alert per lap) until the chain budget tripped. Satisfies CV-C38 / CV-LINT-XS16 (bounded invoke cycle).
- The SL deadline is held as `sl_deadline_us` in context; its numeric value is owned by 24 §8.8, which must be reconciled with ADR-0008 (the two currently disagree: 2 s vs 3000 ms).

## B9 — Rule instance (lifecycle only)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `rule_instance` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `draft` |
| **Owning epic** | E35 - Rule engine IR, compiler & runtime |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §11.5 (evaluation semantics), §11.7 (safety limits), §11.9 (simulation), ADR-0007 |
| **Fit (research)** | Workaround (lifecycle) / **Not suitable** (per-tick evaluation) |
| **Event rate** | lifecycle transitions only; **never per tick** |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 11 / 11 / 0 |

**Purpose.** The armed / triggered / cooldown / paused / kill-switched lifecycle of one rule instance at one scope.

**Why this shape.** **This is a split.** The rule *lifecycle* is a statechart; the rule *condition evaluation* is a compiled Python predicate and is on the do-not-use-for list. Measured: plain Python runs the entire unfiltered 200,000 eval/s workload in 30 ms (6.5 M eval/s) against 8,813 ev/s for a realistic 1,000-machine rule fleet - **~744x**. `evaluate_condition_dag` appears here as an invoked service precisely so that evaluation stays outside the machine.

### B9.4 Invoked services

| In state | `id` | `src` | `onDone` | `onError` |

| `acting` | `act` | `dispatch_actions_in_order` | `cooling_down` | `kill_switched` if `error_budget_exhausted`; `cooling_down` |

### B9.5 Guards

### B9.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `arm_confirmation_ttl` |
| `assert_safety_limits` |
| `bump_consecutive_errors` |
| `bump_simulation_fires` |
| `defer` |
| `emit_armed_audit` |
| `emit_kill_switch_audit` |
| `emit_rules_paused_notice` |
| `evaluate_and_record_simulated` |
| `log_no_op_with_values` |
| `queue_for_human_confirmation` |
| `raise_critical_alert` |
| `raise_partial_alert` |
| `record_fire` |
| `record_partial_fire` |
| `record_skip_debounced` |
| `record_skip_limit` |
| `record_skip_rejected` |
| `record_skip_stale_data` |
| `record_skip_unconfirmed` |
| `reject_promotion_with_reason` |
| `reset_consecutive_errors` |
| `reset_simulation_counters` |
| `stamp_cooldown_deadline` |
| `stamp_simulation_start` |
| `subscribe_triggers` |
| `unsubscribe_triggers` |

### B9.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B9-a** | `TRIGGER` is delivered only by the **pre-filtered** dispatcher. MUST-05: the pre-filter achieves `>= 99 %` rejection, asserted by `cv_rule_prefilter_rejection_ratio`; below 99 % rule dispatch is disabled and alerts, because the budget is shared with the OMS. |
| **INV-B9-b** | Every non-firing outcome is recorded with a reason (debounced / limit / rejected / stale data / unconfirmed). A rule that does not fire is never silent. |
| **INV-B9-c** | `assert_safety_limits` runs on **entry to the acting state**, after confirmation - not only at arm time. |
| **INV-B9-d** | `kill_switched` is exited only by `HUMAN_REARM` with `rearm_permitted_and_elevated`; no automatic recovery exists. |
| **INV-B9-e** | `promotion_gate_satisfied_and_permitted` is deny-polarity: a simulation that cannot be evaluated does not promote. |
| **INV-B9-f** | Conflict arbitration between rules is a deterministic sort in the dispatcher, **not** racing machines (E35-S02/S07). |

### B9.8 Implementation notes

- `dispatch_actions_in_order` is an invoked service so that a partial dispatch surfaces as `onError` and lands the instance in `paused_degraded`, rather than as a raised action that would commit the transition anyway (LC-01).

## B10 — Alert lifecycle

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `alert` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `armed` |
| **Owning epic** | E40 - Alerts & notifications |
| **Schema owner** | **not yet in 24** - see §Gaps below; today alerts exist only in E40 |
| **Fit (research)** | Excellent |
| **Event rate** | human frequencies |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 10 / 10 / 1 |

**Purpose.** One alert instance from armed, through storm suppression, firing and multi-channel delivery, to acknowledgement or resolution.

**Why this shape.** `partially_delivered` and `delivery_failed` are **distinct states**, which the current E40 ticket descriptions do not separate - and the deliveries API needs the difference. Delivery retry is an invoked service with `onError`, the library's strongest measured area (invoke lifecycle 14/14 in Study 05, including cancellation not producing stale `done` events).

| `in_storm_window` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |

### B10.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `bump_delivery_attempts` |
| `bump_storm_count` |
| `emit_delivery_failure_metric` |
| `emit_suppression_metric` |
| `persist_fired_row` |
| `schedule_backoff_deadline` |
| `stamp_storm_window` |

### B10.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B10-a** | `delivery_attempts <= max_delivery_attempts`; exhaustion reaches `delivery_failed`, a visible state, never an infinite retry. |
| **INV-B10-b** | `delivered_channels` is a subset of `channels`; full delivery implies equality, partial delivery implies a proper non-empty subset. |
| **INV-B10-c** | Storm suppression is counted and metricised: a suppressed alert is observable, not dropped. |
| **INV-B10-d** | `persist_fired_row` happens on entry to `firing`, before any channel dispatch - the fired record survives a delivery failure. |

### B10.8 Implementation notes

- Backoff deadlines go to the external scheduler for restore-survivability, even though seconds of lateness would be tolerable here.

## B11 — RecordingSession

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `recording` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `idle` |
| **Owning epic** | E16 - Recorder, retention & disk budget |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §13.1 (recording policy model), ADR-0015 |
| **Fit (research)** | Excellent |
| **Event rate** | per-symbol lifecycle events only |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 8 / 8 / 0 |

**Purpose.** Per-symbol recording lifecycle driven by a set of reasons (explicit list, open chart, open position), with stream health, gap counting and a linger period.

**Why this shape.** Adds `lingering` - today a prose rule in 24 §13.1 with no state - and turns "an open position cannot stop recording" from a scattered check into the guard `position_open_for_symbol`.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `starting` | `sub` | `subscribe_streams` | `recording` | `error` |
| `stopping` | `unsub` | `unsubscribe_and_flush` | `stopped` | `error` |

### B11.5 Guards

| Guard | Polarity | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `all_streams_healthy` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` — **event-aware** | *(2026-09-24, R14-03 fix)* evaluates "every stream healthy **once this event is applied**": overlay `event.stream = True` on `context.streams_healthy` before the check, because guards run against the pre-action context (XState v5 / SCXML). No I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `position_open_for_symbol` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `reasons_remain` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` — **event-aware** | *(2026-09-24, R14-03 fix)* evaluates "reasons remaining **after** this removal" (`len(reasons) - 1 > 0`), because `remove_reason` has not yet run when the guard is evaluated. No I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |

### B11.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `add_reason` |
| `bump_gap_count` |
| `cancel_linger` |
| `emit_gap_metric` |
| `emit_recording_metric` |
| `mark_stream_healthy` |
| `mark_stream_unhealthy` |
| `raise_degraded_alert` |
| `record_error` |
| `remove_reason` |
| `schedule_linger_deadline` |

### B11.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B11-a** | Recording stops only when `reasons` is empty **and** `position_open_for_symbol` is false. A position open for the symbol can never stop recording (ADR-0015). |
| **INV-B11-b** | A reason re-added during `lingering` cancels the linger and returns to recording without a stream restart. |
| **INV-B11-c** | Every gap is counted and metricised; coverage rows are written for captured intervals only. No interpolation, ever (C-2.14). |
| **INV-B11-d** | `degraded` is entered on any unhealthy stream and exited only when **all** streams report healthy. |

### B11.8 Implementation notes

- `lingering` must also appear in the recorder status API and the admin panel (E16).
- **Corrected 2026-09-24 (R14-03 / R13-15 / R13-16, proven in `docs/research/xstate/battle-v0.9.1/contracts/g2_b11_fix.py` on both engines):** (1) `all_streams_healthy` and `reasons_remain` are event-aware (see B11.5) — without this B11 was a one-way trip into `degraded`; (2) `degraded` now handles `GAP_DETECTED` — previously root `onUnhandled: "defer"` swallowed gap telemetry exactly while degraded. Contract test: the G2 script lands in `stopped` with `gap_count_24h == 1`, both services run, `chain_trips == 0`.

## B12 — ReplaySession

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `replay` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `created` |
| **Owning epic** | E26 - Replay engine & scrubbing |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §13.7 (replay engine) |
| **Fit (research)** | Good |
| **Event rate** | control events only; the data path is outside the machine |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 8 / 8 / 1 |

**Purpose.** The transport controls of a replay session: prepare, buffer, play, pause, step, seek, loop, finish.

**Why this shape.** The machine owns **control**, never data. `emit_one_step` is an invoked service for the stepping case; the streaming path is ordinary code driven by the replay clock. Putting replayed market events through an interpreter would reintroduce exactly the hot-path cost MUSTNOT-01 forbids.

| `buffering` | `seek` | `seek_and_prime` | `paused` | `error` |
| `stepping` | `step` | `emit_one_step` | `paused` | `error` |

### B12.5 Guards

| Guard | Polarity | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `loop_enabled` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |

### B12.6 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `defer` |
| `record_coverage` |
| `record_error` |
| `reset_cursor_to_start` |
| `set_cursor` |
| `set_speed` |
| `slow_clock` |
| `start_clock` |
| `stop_clock` |

### B12.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B12-a** | Determinism (C-2.15): the same session parameters over the same recorded range produce byte-identical output across runs - and parity is measured over **delivered event sets** per machine, not only over derived outputs (E26-T06). |
| **INV-B12-b** | `cursor` moves monotonically during playback; only `SEEK` may move it backwards. |
| **INV-B12-c** | `CONSUMER_SLOW` slows the clock; it never drops events. Backpressure is coalescing on the transport, not lossy in the replay source (P6). |
| **INV-B12-d** | `coverage_gaps` are surfaced to the consumer as explicit gaps, never interpolated (C-2.14). |
| **INV-B12-e** | `destroyed` releases the paper account and the source handles exactly once. |

## B13 — ExchangeConnection (WS reconnect / resync)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `ws_conn` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `disconnected` |
| **Owning epic** | E08 - Bybit adapter & ingestion skeleton |
| **Schema owner** | 20-architecture.md §3.1, §10.4 (reconnect and resync); 24 §14.2-14.3 |
| **Fit (research)** | Good |
| **Event rate** | rare transitions; steady state is a heartbeat |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 9 / 9 / 1 |

**Purpose.** One WebSocket connection's lifecycle: connect, authenticate, subscribe in batches, live with heartbeats, backoff, close - plus the connection-rate budget.

**Why this shape.** `budget_blocked` is an explicit state. Bybit's connection-rate limit is a known-limit-ledger entry (20 §1.2), and a reconnect storm that silently burns it is a self-inflicted outage; making it a state makes it observable and alertable.

### B13.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B13-a** | `connection_budget_exhausted` is checked **before** opening a socket; the machine never attempts a connection it knows it cannot afford. |
| **INV-B13-b** | Backoff is jittered and monotonically increasing up to `max_backoff_ms`; it resets only on reaching `live`. |
| **INV-B13-c** | `subscribed_topics` after subscribing equals `pending_topics`; a partial batch subscribe re-enters subscribing rather than declaring `live`. |
| **INV-B13-d** | Health is published as a plain flag consumed by dependents. **No hot path queries this interpreter** (MUSTNOT-03). |
| **INV-B13-e** | Pong deadlines are absolute timestamps armed externally and re-armed on restore. |

### B13.8 Implementation notes

- This machine consumes the shared `SafeInterpreter`/`MachineGateway` utility (E29-T11) rather than its own interpreter handling.

## B14 — Book health FSM (data path excluded)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `book` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `init` |
| **Owning epic** | E08 - Bybit adapter & ingestion skeleton |
| **Schema owner** | 20-architecture.md §3.2 (book engine), §4.2 (backpressure) |
| **Fit (research)** | **Not suitable** (data path) / Good (health FSM with the data path excluded) |
| **Event rate** | health transitions only - resync/desync, not deltas |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 4 / 4 / 0 |

**Purpose.** The per-symbol order-book **health** state - awaiting snapshot, live, desynced - and the snapshot/delta sequencing discipline around it.

**Why this shape.** **This is the most dangerous machine in the catalogue to misread.** The contract specifies the health transitions and the sequencing rule. `apply_delta` and `buffer_delta` are named as actions **in the contract** so that the sequencing rule is stated in exactly one place; in the implementation they are plain function calls on the book engine's hot path, and **the per-delta path never enters an interpreter**. Measured: 48k ev/s of deltas against a ~9-20k process budget, with a 33 us statechart tax on 15-60 us of real work.

### B14.6 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B14-a** | **MUSTNOT-01 is absolute here.** Delta application, bar building and footprint aggregation are never executed by a statechart, in any form, including internal actions-only transitions. |
| **INV-B14-b** | Health is published as a plain bool/enum on state entry; consumers read the flag, they do not call `matches()` (MUSTNOT-03 - even *gating* by querying an interpreter measured 12x a bool read). |
| **INV-B14-c** | A sequence gap always drops state and re-snapshots; deltas are never applied across a gap (C-2.5, P5). |
| **INV-B14-d** | Deltas buffered while awaiting a snapshot are replayed strictly after `snapshot_seq`, and the buffer is bounded (C-2.18). |
| **INV-B14-e** | `resync_count` and `desynced_since_us` are exported; a symbol resyncing repeatedly is visible. |

### B14.7 Implementation notes

- If a future reader is tempted to "just add an internal transition" for delta application because the contract names the action - that is precisely the failure MUSTNOT-01 exists to prevent.

## B15 — Paper-account liquidation FSM

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `paper_account` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `active` |
| **Owning epic** | E38 - Paper trading & demo/live parity |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §12.4 (margin, liquidation and ADL) |
| **Fit (research)** | **Not suitable** (paper matcher) / contract-only (account liquidation FSM) |
| **Event rate** | **edge-triggered only** - on band change, never per tick |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 4 / 4 / 1 |

**Purpose.** The margin-call / liquidation state of a simulated account.

**Why this shape.** Catalogued because it is a genuine three-state FSM that 24 §12.4 currently expresses as prose. The surrounding **paper matcher is on the do-not-use-for list**: the fill model, queue-position estimator and fee/funding arithmetic have no states and need virtual time, which no runtime here provides.

### B15.6 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B15-a** | `MARK_UPDATE` is **edge-triggered**: the margin evaluator computes the band in plain Python and sends an event only on a band change. Level-triggering this machine on mark updates would put market-rate traffic into the shared budget. |
| **INV-B15-b** | The liquidated state is terminal; the account is not silently revived by a favourable mark. |
| **INV-B15-c** | `write_liquidation_journal` runs before the terminal transition settles, so a liquidation is always journalled. |
| **INV-B15-d** | Paper and live use the same OMS code path; only the matcher differs (E38 demo/live parity). |

## B16 — AuthSession / step-up

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `session` |
| **Root type** | `parallel` (orthogonal regions) |
| **Owning epic** | E09 - Auth, sessions, 2FA & RBAC |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §15.1 (session model), §15.3 (step-up), ADR-0010 |
| **Fit (research)** | Good |
| **Event rate** | low; documented ~100-session threshold per process |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 7 / 5 / 1 |

**Purpose.** One session's authentication state and, orthogonally, its elevation (step-up) state.

**Why this shape.** Two regions: `auth` (pending MFA / active / revoked) and `elevation` (normal / elevated). `elevated_until_us` becomes a **derived value of the elevation region** rather than a column someone can forget to check.

### B16.6 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B16-a** | Elevation cannot outlive the session: leaving the active auth state clears elevation unconditionally. |
| **INV-B16-b** | Every revocation records a specific reason (logout / idle / expired / admin / locked / timeout) and is broadcast to connected clients. |
| **INV-B16-c** | Every step-up attempt, success or failure, writes an audit record (C-2.9). |
| **INV-B16-d** | `revoked` is terminal for that session id; a session is never un-revoked. |
| **INV-B16-e** | Deadlines (absolute, idle, elevation) are absolute timestamps evaluated on access, so a deadline that expired while the process was down is honoured on restore. |

> **Corrected 2026-09-24 (C-04 / R13-13 / R14-03, proven in `docs/research/xstate/battle-v0.9.1/contracts/g4_c04_c07b.py`, 11/11 both engines):** the four revocation events are hoisted to the root and target the new final `elevation.dead`, and the region-level `elevated.on.REVOKE` handler is **deleted** — a deeper handler outranks the root arm, so leaving it in landed `REVOKE` in `normal`, re-elevatable (the root hoist alone fixed 9/12 lanes). Re-elevation `STEP_UP_OK` now also audits (INV-B16-c). This closes INV-B16-a on every kill event.

### B16.7 Implementation notes

- Session machines are single-process-owned; beyond roughly 100 concurrent sessions the hosting assumption is re-examined (E09).

## B17 — LiveEnablement gate

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `live_gate` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `locked` |
| **Owning epic** | E44 - Live-enablement gating & environment separation |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §15.3; `07-release-and-prr.md` §6 (live-enablement gate) |
| **Fit (research)** | Excellent |
| **Event rate** | extremely low; audit-shaped |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 3 / 3 / 0 |

**Purpose.** The three-state gate controlling whether live trading may be enabled at all: locked, eligible, enabled.

**Why this shape.** `eligible` is **distinct from `locked`**: "all PRR evidence is present but nobody has enabled it" is a different fact from "evidence is missing", and only the first can be acted on. The feature flag becomes a *projection* of this state rather than the source of truth.

## B18 — KillSwitch

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `kill_switch` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `clear` |
| **Owning epic** | E39 - Risk caps, lockouts & kill-switch |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §11.7 (safety limits and kill switches); 20 §4.3; ADR-0008 rule 8 |
| **Fit (research)** | Good - as record-and-orchestrate only |
| **Event rate** | extremely low |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 6 / 6 / 0 |

**Purpose.** Engage the kill switch: block new orders, cancel working orders, flatten positions, and record what actually completed.

**Why this shape.** `engaged_incomplete` exists because "we tried to flatten and some accounts are still open" is the state that actually matters operationally, and it must page rather than be rounded up to `engaged`.

| `record_engagement` |

### B18.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B18-a** | **MUSTNOT-05 / MUSTNOT-03: the block is a synchronous flag.** `block_new_orders_immediately` runs on entry to the engaging state and sets a plain boolean the `Validator` reads. Measured, asking an interpreter costs 33.5 ms p50 / 50.8 ms max at a realistic 2,854-interpreter fleet - and `send()` is fire-and-forget, so it cannot answer "am I blocked?" at all. |
| **INV-B18-b** | Blocking takes effect **before** the event that records it is processed (E39-S03/Q03: asserted with the loop saturated). |
| **INV-B18-c** | `engaged` requires `accounts_flat == accounts_total`; anything less is `engaged_incomplete` and pages the owner. |
| **INV-B18-d** | Release requires owner + elevation + explicit acknowledgement of the residual. |
| **INV-B18-e** | Engagement and release are audited with actor, scope, reason and timestamps (C-2.9). |
| **INV-B18-f** | *(2026-09-24, C-07b fix)* A guard-denied `RELEASE` never faults the machine: it is audited (`audit_release_denied`) and the switch stays `engaged` and releasable. Root `onUnhandled` is `"defer"`, not `"error"`. |

> **Corrected 2026-09-24 (C-07b / R13-14 / R14-03, proven in `g4_c04_c07b.py` on both engines):** under the former root `onUnhandled: "error"`, a guard-denied `RELEASE` made the kill switch fatal and permanently bricked. Fix = `"defer"` + an ordered unguarded audit arm after the guarded `RELEASE`.

## B19 — Reconciliation job

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `reconciliation` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `idle` |
| **Owning epic** | E45 - Reconciliation, chaos & failover resilience |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §8.5 (reconciliation algorithm), §14.3; 20 §10.4 |
| **Fit (research)** | Good |
| **Event rate** | periodic sweeps plus event-triggered runs |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 8 / 8 / 0 |

**Purpose.** Fetch authoritative exchange state, diff it against local state, remediate, report - and lock the account out if reconciliation itself cannot succeed.

**Why this shape.** A linear pipeline of long-running invokes, which is the strongest measured shape: cancelling a mid-flight sweep delivers `CancelledError`, honours `finally`, returns promptly, and does **not** later deliver a stale `done.invoke`. A stale reconciliation result applied after a newer sweep would be a genuine corruption path. `stale_lockout` is added explicitly - E45-T02 mentions stale-account lockout but 24 §8.5 does not model it.

### B19.7 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B19-a** | Reconciliation must not share a failure mode with what it repairs: the supervisor starts this machine **before** the OMS accepts orders, and its own faults escalate to `stale_lockout` rather than retrying forever. |
| **INV-B19-b** | `stale_lockout` locks the account for new orders and is cleared only by `OPERATOR_RESOLVED`. |
| **INV-B19-c** | Diffs are by `orderLinkId` (C-2.10); `Unknown` orders are resolved by lookup, never by blind resubmission. |
| **INV-B19-d** | `auto_remediate` is a **context value**, not a separate machine - capabilities drive behaviour, not conditionals (24 §14.3). |
| **INV-B19-e** | A crash during fetching is re-driven on restore by re-sending the triggering event; a machine parked mid-fetch with no live service is a silent hang, and is the single most consequential consequence of static restore (LC-19). E45-T06/T07 chaos-test exactly this. |
| **INV-B19-f** | Every sweep persists a report, whether or not divergences were found. |

## B20 — RiskLockout

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine `id`** | `risk_lockout` |
| **Root type** | `compound`, initial `clear` |
| **Owning epic** | E39 - Risk caps, lockouts & kill-switch |
| **Schema owner** | 24-internal-schemas.md §11.7 (safety limits) |
| **Fit (research)** | Good |
| **Event rate** | **edge-triggered** on band change only |
| **States / leaves / finals** | 3 / 3 / 0 |

**Purpose.** Per-account risk lockout: clear, warning band, locked - with day-boundary or duration-based expiry and a step-up override.

**Why this shape.** `warning` is a distinct server-side state; today it is implicit in the dashboard design with no server representation. The lockout follows B18's architecture: the machine records, a synchronous flag enforces.

### B20.4 Guards

| Guard | Polarity | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `breaches_daily_loss_cap` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `outside_warning_band` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `owner_and_elevated_and_override_permitted` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `until_mode_is_time_based` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |
| `within_warning_band` | pure predicate over `(context, event)` | no I/O; total; returns `False` on any internal error and logs at `ERROR` (A6) |

### B20.5 Actions

All actions are `@cv_action`-wrapped (A1). A raising action writes `context["_fault"]`, aborts the transition and routes to this machine's fault state; the snapshot writer refuses to persist a faulted context (MUST-01).

| Action |
|---|
| `audit_lockout` |
| `audit_override` |
| `audit_override_denied` |
| `broadcast_lockout` |
| `compute_until` |
| `emit_risk_warning` |
| `halt_new_orders` |
| `log_expiry_ignored_manual_mode` |
| `raise_lockout_alert` |
| `reset_daily_counters_if_new_day` |
| `resume_new_orders` |
| `schedule_expiry_deadline` |
| `set_breach_daily_loss` |
| `set_breach_from_event` |
| `set_breach_manual` |
| `update_pnl` |

### B20.6 Invariants

| ID | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **INV-B20-a** | **MUSTNOT-05: `halt_new_orders` sets a synchronous flag consulted by the `Validator`**, not a query against this interpreter. |
| **INV-B20-b** | `PNL_UPDATE` is **edge-triggered on band change**. The risk evaluator computes the band in plain Python; level-triggering on mark updates would put market-rate traffic into the shared budget. |
| **INV-B20-c** | `breaches_daily_loss_cap` is deny-polarity (A6): a failure or exception blocks trading, never permits it. |
| **INV-B20-d** | A next-UTC-day expiry is an absolute timestamp in context, scheduled externally and re-armed on restore - **and on restore the machine re-evaluates whether the boundary already passed while the process was down**, because nothing re-fires a deadline that expired during downtime (E39-K01, E39-S02). |
| **INV-B20-e** | Manual mode ignores expiry deadlines and logs that it did so; a manual lock is never cleared by a clock. |
| **INV-B20-f** | Overrides require owner + elevation + permission, and are audited, including denials. |

### B20.7 Implementation notes

- The "deadline expired while the process was down" case is a class of bug that static restore creates across B5, B6, B16, B19 and B20 alike; it is handled once in the boot procedure, not per machine.

---

## 21. Cross-cutting contracts

These hold for every machine above. They are stated once here rather than repeated twenty times.

### 21.1 Reserved context keys

| Key | Type | Meaning | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_deferred` | list | events received in a state with no matching handler | drained at boot **unconditionally, before invokes are re-driven** (MUST-03); alerts if non-empty for > 5 s (MUST-04) |
| `_fault` | object / null | the record written by `@cv_action` when an action raised | a context carrying `_fault` is **never persisted**; a `quarantined` marker row is written and P1 alerts (MUST-01) |
| `*_us` | int / null | an **absolute** microsecond deadline | armed by the external `MonotonicScheduler`; re-armed from context on restore; a deadline that expired during downtime is resolved at boot, not silently skipped (A2) |

### 21.2 Deferral and ordering

Every state occupied while an exchange round trip is in flight is covered by the runtime's own `onUnhandled: "defer"` buffer (§1.3b); the retired A3 scaffolding (`` plus `drain_deferred` on entry) has been **stripped from every contract in this document** as of the round-5 pass — see §1.3b. Three consequences are binding:

1. **INV-5 is a per-family test**, not a nice-to-have: every delivered event id appears in the machine's applied set or in `_deferred`. This is the only regression test for silent event loss.
2. **Ordering is not a guarantee across a defer/drain boundary** (MUSTNOT-04). `apply_fill` and every aggregation action must be order-independent and sort by `(ts_exec, seq)` itself. Interpreter FIFO is not an OMS ordering guarantee.
3. **No bus message is acked before the resulting transition is observed** (MUSTNOT-07). The interpreter queue is volatile and absent from the snapshot.

### 21.3 Aggregate decisions

Every aggregate decision is a **pure function of context**, never of event arrival order. A raised event is queued behind pending external events rather than settling inside the macrostep, so a raised `EVALUATE` may be observed *after* a later external event. B2 is the worked example; the rule is universal.

### 21.4 Boot and restore

Restore is static: it does not re-run entry actions, does not restart invokes and does not re-arm deadlines. The boot procedure is therefore fixed, and identical for every family:

1. Restore the snapshot through the wrapper that merges `{**machine_defaults, **snapshot_context}` (MUST-06).
2. Verify `machine_hash`; on mismatch apply a registered upcaster with a golden-snapshot test, or fail closed. **No no-op upcasters** (MUSTNOT-09, MUST-12).
3. **Drain `_deferred`** through the gateway with dedupe, then clear it (MUST-03).
4. Re-drive every state carrying an `invoke`, by re-sending its triggering event.
5. Re-arm every `*_us` deadline from context, resolving any that expired during downtime.
6. Reconcile against the exchange before accepting new orders.

Step 3 must precede step 4. The two mitigations are coupled: a drain that lives only in an invoke target's `entry` strands the buffer forever after a crash, and the machine sits looking healthy with unapplied fills in its own context.

### 21.5 Observability (every machine)

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `cv_machine_live_count{kind}` | live interpreters per family; alerts on monotonic growth (MUST-11) |
| `cv_machine_deferred_depth{kind}` | deferral-buffer depth; alerts above 0 for > 5 s (MUST-04) |
| `cv_machine_unhandled_events_total{kind,event}` | events with no handler; **CI fails** if a gateway sends an event absent from the machine's descriptor set (MUST-10) |
| `cv_machine_transition_seconds{kind}` | transition latency |
| `cv_machine_quarantined_total{kind}` | faulted transitions (A1 / MUST-01) |
| `cv_rule_prefilter_rejection_ratio` | B9 pre-filter quality; must hold at or above 0.99 (MUST-05) |

Every machine reaching a terminal state is explicitly stopped and evicted by the supervisor reaper (MUST-11). A terminal machine that is merely "done" still retains its context, its queue and its subscriptions.

### 21.6 Hot-path boundary objects

Four components exist purely to keep market-rate traffic out of the machines above. They are plain Python and they are **not** statecharts:

| Component | Feeds | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| `ChaseTargetTracker` | B7 `BOOK_TARGET_MOVED` | decimates book updates to at most 10 Hz |
| Rule trigger pre-filter (index) | B9 `TRIGGER` | must reject at least 99 %; below that, dispatch is disabled and alerts (MUST-05) |
| Risk band evaluator | B15 `MARK_UPDATE`, B20 `PNL_UPDATE` | edge-triggers on band change only |
| Rate-limit governor (token bucket) | B2 `reserve_rate_budget` | synchronous pre-flight admission; ~238,000x faster than the chart form, and able to answer synchronously at all (MUSTNOT-02) |

---

## 22. Gaps this catalogue exposes in the owning documents

Contracts were derived from `24-internal-schemas.md` and `20-architecture.md`. Six places where the contract is richer than its owning section. Each needs an edit in the **owning** document, not here (`CONSTITUTION.md` §16.5 single-source rule):

| Contract | Gap | Owner to update |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | `quarantined` is a fourteenth lifecycle state with no counterpart in the status enum; binding rules **S10** (deferral / no dropped fills) and **S11** (no action may raise) are new | `24` §8.2 |
| B3 | The per-account unwind is specified in prose in §9.5.1 and has **no ticket anywhere in the backlog** | `24` §9.5.1 + E34 |
| B8 | The SL deadline is 2 s in `24` §8.8 and 3000 ms in ADR-0008 — the two disagree and must be reconciled | `24` §8.8 / ADR-0008 |
| B10 | There is **no Alert schema section at all**; alerts exist only in E40, while every other stateful entity is specified in `24` | `24` — new §13.8 |
| B11 | `lingering` is a prose rule with no state in the enum | `24` §13.1 |
| B19 / B20 | `stale_lockout` and `warning` have no server-side representation | `24` §8.5, §11.7 |

---

## 23. Conformance

### 23.1 What conformance means

An implementation conforms to a contract when, for every event sequence, it produces **the same state trace and the same action trace** as the contract. Concretely:

- State names, event names, guard names and action names match the JSON exactly.
- The transition table matches: same source, same event, same guard ordering, same target.
- Every invariant in that entry's invariants table has a test.
- Deferral coverage matches: every state the contract marks as deferring actually defers.

Conformance is asserted on the library itself: the contract suite drives the chart through `cv.statechart.factory` with the production `logic` (or pure stubs for guard-matrix tests) and compares traces.

### 23.2 The gates

| Gate | Ticket | What it blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Machine JSON schema + Stately-compatibility validation | `E50-T01` | any malformed or non-portable contract |
| Target resolution, deferral coverage, `reenter`, action-decorator and guard-purity lint | `E29-T10` | the first statechart — MUST-09 requires it to land **before**, not alongside |
| `machine_hash` in CI | `E50-T02` | a semantic change to a shipped machine without a version bump or a registered upcaster (MUST-12) |
| Library contract suite (`tests/xstate_contract/`) | `E50-T03` | any divergence between a chart's golden state/action traces and what `xstate-statemachine` executes via `cv.statechart.factory`; includes the drain→restore round-trip (CV-C65′) and the four 2026-09-24 corrections (B8, B11, B16, B18) |
| Event-name coverage | `E50-T05` | a gateway sending an event no machine declares (MUST-10) |
| `tests/xstate_contract/` under 60 s | `E50-T06` | a gate slow enough to be skipped, which is not a gate |
| Upstream gate on pin bumps | `E50-T04` | bumping `xstate-statemachine==0.9.1` without a green `run_gate.py` + contract suite + BENCH-6 (`bench_c_timers_v2.py`) |

### 23.3 Pin and upgrade

There is no runtime switch. Every family runs on the pinned library from its first ticket. A new upstream release is adopted only by a PR that bumps the exact pin (never `~=`/`>=`) after `docs/research/xstate/gate/run_gate.py`, the contract suite on both engines, and BENCH-6 are green, recorded as a dated ADR-0016 amendment.
