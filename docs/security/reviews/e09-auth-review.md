# E09 security review — auth, sessions, 2FA, RBAC, audit (E09-X04)

- Ticket: E09-X04 (#300). Threat model: `docs/security/threat-models/e09-auth-rbac.md` (E09-X01).
  Abuse cases: `docs/security/abuse-cases/e09-auth.md` (E09-X02). CI gates:
  `docs/security/auth-security-gates.md` (E09-X03).
- Reviewed against `main` at `06a742b` (2026-10-09). Paths are relative to
  `services/api/candleviewer/` unless they start with `services/` or `docs/`.
- Method: white-box code walk by an agent, plus one automated drill counterpart (§4). This was
  not the conversational review with the epic owner that the ticket describes; that session is
  still needed.

Verdict key: **PASS** (control exists in code and a named test exercises it) ·
**PARTIAL** (some exists, some gap; ticketed or flagged) · **FAIL-T** (missing, owning ticket
named) · **OPEN** (missing, and no owning ticket was found, so it needs triage) ·
**NOT EXECUTED**.

## 1. Control-by-control verdicts (SR-010..SR-029, SR-050, SR-051)

| Control | Implementation (file:line) | Proving test | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| SR-010 local auth, no anonymous routes | `api/deny_by_default.py:70` `assert_app_routes_declared`, `:84` runtime deny | `tests/unit/api/test_deny_by_default.py::test_runtime_denies_undeclared_route_with_403` | PASS |
| SR-011 Argon2id, params stored, rehash on login | `auth/hashing.py:31` (m=65536,t=3,p=4), `:104` `needs_rehash`; `auth/login_service.py:131` | `tests/unit/auth/test_hashing.py::test_hasher_needs_rehash_true_for_stale_params`; AC-CRED-01 | PASS. The ≥100 ms on-host cost is not measured here (see E09-Q05 / #2097) |
| SR-012 opaque tokens, cookie flags | `auth/session_service.py:115,158` (`secrets.token_urlsafe`); `api/sessions.py:187-189` (HttpOnly, SameSite=strict) | AC-CSRF-03 (`tests/security/auth/test_csrf_cookie_abuse.py`) | PASS. The double-submit CSRF token is a separate item, see F-1/#2090 |
| SR-013 rotate on login, TOTP, step-up, password change, role change | Rotation exists for MFA-completion mint (`api/auth.py:327`) and refresh (`auth/session_service.py:195`). Role change pushes `permission_change` (`api/users.py:199`) but does not re-mint the session id. No step-up rotation found. Password change route not implemented (see SR-028) | AC-SES-01..04; `tests/unit/ws/test_gateway_e2e.py::test_ws_e2e_permissions_sub_check_and_live_role_change` | PARTIAL, finding R-1 (#2101) |
| SR-014 uniform login failures + dummy verify | `auth/login_service.py:105` (`verify_dummy`), `:128` disabled revealed only after correct password | AC-ENUM-01/03; `tests/unit/auth/test_login_timing_enumeration.py` | PASS. AC-ENUM-02 is a design decision (F-2 family) |
| SR-015 per-account + per-IP throttling | `auth/throttle.py:22`; `auth/login_service.py:93` (checked before hash) | `tests/unit/auth/test_login_service.py::test_per_ip_throttle_blocks_independent_of_username`; AC-CRED-03 | PASS |
| SR-016 lockout + owner alert | `auth/login_service.py:44-45` (5 failures, 15 min; stricter than the SR's 10) | `test_lockout_after_five_failures_refuses_even_correct_password`; AC-CRED-04/05 | PARTIAL. The owner alert on lockout was not verified (AC-CRED-05 NOT RUN) |
| SR-017 deny-by-default start-up | `api/deny_by_default.py:70` | `test_build_fails_for_route_without_declaration` | PASS |
| SR-018 route × role matrix | `services/api/tests/contract/rbac/matrix.yaml` | `services/api/tests/contract/rbac/test_route_matrix.py`, `test_scope_and_ws.py` (E09-Q03) | PASS |
| SR-019 list and revoke own sessions | `api/sessions.py:427` (list), `:511` (revoke one) | `tests/unit/api/test_sessions_router.py`; AC-CSRF-05 | PASS |
| SR-020 mandatory TOTP | `auth/mfa_service.py`, MFA leg of `/auth/login` → `/auth/mfa/verify` (`api/auth.py:288`) | `tests/unit/auth/test_mfa_service.py` | PASS for login. First-login enrolment enforcement is UI flow (E09-Q02) and was not reviewed here |
| SR-021 ±1 skew + replay cache | `auth/totp.py:24,79`; `auth/mfa_service.py:126,210` (`record_time_step`) | `tests/unit/auth/test_totp.py::test_verify_code_rejects_beyond_skew_window`; AC-MFA-01 | PASS |
| SR-022 recovery codes | `auth/recovery_codes.py:33` (10), `:50` (≈138 bit), `:65` (HMAC-SHA256 keyed, not Argon2id); `auth/mfa_service.py:265` consume, `:290` regenerate | `test_recovery_code_entropy_is_at_least_128_bits`; AC-MFA-03/04/05 | PASS with deviation D-1 (keyed HMAC in place of Argon2id, recorded in the module docstring). The Owner alert on use was not verified |
| SR-023 break-glass CLI | **Not in the repo.** `grep` finds `break-glass`/`SR-023` only in docs | none | **OPEN** (#1778 item AB), see §3 |
| SR-024 timeouts + 12 h trading freshness | `auth/session_service.py:61` (12 h absolute), `:64` (12 min access token), `:69-71` (idle 15 min default, 5–60 min); all stricter than the SR's 8 h / 7 d | `tests/unit/auth/test_session_service.py` | PARTIAL. No separate 12-hour trading-capability freshness check found on order paths (`mfa_satisfied_at` is stored at `:173` but not consulted by `oms`/`risk`), finding R-2 (#2108) |
| SR-025 step-up, 5 min, scoped | `auth/step_up.py:46` (5 min grace), `:51` action classes, `:53` no-grace classes, `:320` `require_elevation`; `api/users.py:141` | `tests/unit/auth/test_step_up.py`; AC-STEP-01..04 | PASS. The SR asks for password + TOTP; the code verifies TOTP only, deviation D-2 |
| SR-026 no target-user on self-service | Semgrep `no-target-user-on-self-service` (E09-X03) | rule fixtures under `security/semgrep/auth/fixtures/` | PASS (static) |
| SR-027 invite creates least-privilege user | `auth/models.py:339` (`InviteRole`: manager/viewer only, owner not invitable); `auth/invite_service.py:137` | `tests/unit/api/test_invites_router.py::test_create_rejects_owner_role_and_duplicate`; AC-INV-01..04 | PARTIAL. An invite may carry `manager` directly; the SR requires `Viewer` plus a separate audited elevation, finding R-3 (#2109) |
| SR-028 password policy + other-session revoke | `auth/invite_service.py:66,93` (≥12 chars, local deny list, identity checks) | invite-redeem tests | PARTIAL. `PUT /auth/password` (OpenAPI `/auth/password`) has no router, so "change revokes other sessions" does not exist yet, finding R-4 (#2110). The full breached-password corpus is deferred (`invite_service.py:68`) |
| SR-029 disable user → sessions, sockets, pending actions | Primitives exist: `auth/session_service.py:409` `revoke_all`, `ws/revocation.py:54-67` hub, `app.py:811` wiring. The `DELETE /users/{userId}` cascade is **not implemented** | `services/api/tests/security/auth/test_disable_user_drill.py` (automated counterpart, §4) | FAIL-T: cascade owned by E42-T04 (#965) |
| SR-050 two-layer authZ | Layer 1 deny-by-default + `x-rbac`; layer 2 `auth/scopes.py:124` `decide`, `:201` `enforce` | AC-AUTHZ-02/04; E09-Q03 matrix | PARTIAL. #2094 isolates the rules-manager layer-2 test |
| SR-051 server-side account resolution | `auth/scopes.py:151` (OBJECT_REQUIRED), `:158` (ACCOUNT_NOT_GRANTED); Semgrep `no-raw-account-id` | AC-AUTHZ-02/03 | PASS (domain layer). Query-construction scoping on list endpoints belongs to the consuming epics |

### 1.1 Other items in the brief

| Detections: lockouts, authz denied | `observability/metrics_catalogue.py:1001` (`auth_lockouts_total`), `:1021` (`authz_denied_total`) | catalogue tests | PASS for the metrics. Alert routes for chain failure, binding failure and break-glass use were not verified |

## 2. Findings triage

Dates are when the item was raised. "Due" is a review-by date that the owner still has to confirm.
No item is marked accepted: an accepted risk needs a dated Owner signature, and there is none.

Rows R-1 to R-7 and D-1/D-2 come from this review. Each is now tracked: R-1 #2101, R-2 #2108,
R-3 #2109, R-4 #2110, R-5 #2111, R-7 #965. Owner decisions are on #1778
([items AB–AE](https://github.com/basiltt/CandleViewer/issues/1778#issuecomment-6079001525)): AB is the R-6 break-glass CLI, which has no owning ticket and is proposed as
a new E09 Story; AC is R-3; AD is D-1; AE is D-2. The sign-off is item U.

## 3. Break-glass drill (SR-023): NOT EXECUTED

- **Blocked by a missing artefact.** No offline break-glass CLI exists in the repository. A
  search of every epic backlog (`docs/plan/backlog/*.json`) and of GitHub issues found **no
  ticket that implements it**. E09-K02 (#292) only *documents* the runbook procedure and is
  itself blocked by this ticket. E09-X01 names the CLI as a trust boundary. E43-T04 reviews
  lockout but does not build it. It is raised for an Owner decision as #1778 item AB (a new E09
  Story is proposed).
- **Blocked by environment.** The drill needs a staging host with a staging KEK and an engineer
  who did not write the runbook, with a scribe. An agent cannot provide either.
- Not recorded, because nothing was run: elapsed lockout-to-recovery time, runbook ambiguities,
  refusal without filesystem access or KEK, the audit event, and the UI notice.
- The automated counterpart the ticket asks for
  (`test_break_glass_requires_host_filesystem_and_kek_present`) cannot be written until the CLI
  exists.

## 4. Disable-user drill (SR-029): automated counterpart only

The staging drill by a human is **still required**. What ran is an in-process counterpart:
`services/api/tests/security/auth/test_disable_user_drill.py`.

- Setup: the real `create_app()` and the app's own `RevocationHub`. A real `SessionService` and
  `StepUpService` run over in-memory session/MFA fakes on an injected clock. There are two live
  sessions for the user and an open `/ws` socket that is authenticated and subscribed
  (`book.BTCUSDT.50`). Pending activity is a recorded step-up challenge. A bystander user has a
  session of their own.
- Action: `SessionService.revoke_all(user, reason="user_disabled")`, then `RevocationHub.revoke`
  for each revoked session. These are the primitives the E42-T04 cascade has to call; the
  `DELETE /users/{userId}` route itself does not exist yet.
- Observed: both sessions are revoked, with `revoked_at` equal to the action instant on the
  injected clock (0.000 s injected delay). The SR-029 bound is asserted on the injected clock
  only; no wall-clock figure is asserted. Their access tokens are refused. The socket receives
  `bye` (`code 4401`, `reason user_disabled`, `reconnect false`). The pending step-up challenge
  can no longer be read or completed. The revoked token cannot open a new socket. The
  bystander's session is untouched. Repeating the action is idempotent. The operational latency
  the Owner needs comes only from the staging drill.
- Every WS read has a 5 s deadline. With the `bye` send removed from `RevocationHub.revoke`, the
  test fails in about 5 s ("no WS frame within 5.0s"); it does not hang. The mutation was reverted.
- **Not covered**, because it does not exist yet and belongs to E42-T04 (#965) or E35:
  `users.status=disabled`, grant revocation, disarming the user's rules (rule-engine pending
  actions), the recorded positions decision in the audit log, and the `users.disable` audit row.
  Pending *rule-engine* actions are therefore **not** shown to be cancelled. Only session-scoped
  pending state is.

## 5. Residual risks

1. **Total Owner lockout has no tested recovery path** (SR-023 / U10). Until a CLI exists and a
   drill passes, losing the TOTP device and the recovery codes means rebuilding identity by
   hand at the database. This is a High residual and blocks R0.
2. **Disable is not yet a single action.** Until E42-T04 lands, an operator has to revoke
   sessions and freeze grants separately. Rules authored by a disabled user stay armed.
3. **Bearer-token theft window** (F-2). It is bounded by the 12 min access-token TTL and by
   refresh-reuse detection.
4. **CSRF depends on the bearer-header model staying true** (F-1 / #2090).
5. **Session fixation surface on privilege change** (R-1). It is mitigated by short token TTLs
   and server-side permission refresh, but the SR-013 rotation set is incomplete.
6. **Audit tampering detection is on-demand only** (R-5) until a nightly verifier and its alert
   route exist.

## 6. Pen-test scoping note for E43

Controls that most warrant external testing before R4 live enablement, in priority order:

1. The deny-by-default route registry and the `x-rbac` → `decide()` second layer (SR-017,
   SR-050, SR-051), using cross-account identifiers in body, path and query, and WS topic options.
2. Session lifecycle: refresh rotation and family revocation, idle and absolute expiry, WS
   revocation on logout or disable, and the bearer-only state-change model (F-1, F-2).
3. Step-up scope and grace window across action classes and sessions (SR-025).
4. The mesh-only middleware and binding self-check on the deployed host (US-ONB-008, RSK-022).
5. Audit append-only guarantees under the application role, and chain verification (E43-T10).
6. The break-glass CLI, once it exists: precondition enforcement (host filesystem + KEK) and
   attempt recording.
7. Login throttling and lockout as a denial-of-service vector (U27, U28), coordinated with
   E43-T04.

Out of scope for this note: the key vault (E27) and the order path beyond its `authorize()`
calls.
