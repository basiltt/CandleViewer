# E08 — STRIDE threat model: Exchange boundary and ingestion pipeline

- Ticket: E08-X01 (issue #187)
- Owner: Security engineer (CODEOWNER)
- Status: Draft — pending Architect + epic-owner review session (see §7)
- Re-derives and extends `docs/plan/04-security-program.md` §5.5 (W1–W11, area "WebSocket ingestion &
  fan-out") and the exchange-API-key area (§5.1, K-series, referenced not repeated) against the concrete
  design landed in E08-T01 (`services/api/candleviewer/exchange/base/`, `exchange/bybit/`) and
  `docs/plan/24-internal-schemas.md` §14 (ports, adapter rules), plus the ingestion component design in
  `docs/plan/20-architecture.md` §3.1–3.4 (C4 L3 M3–M6).
- Classification: this document itself is sensitive only in that it enumerates weaknesses; no live
  credentials, host allowlists beyond what `20-architecture.md`/`24-internal-schemas.md` already publish,
  or egress IPs appear below.

## 1. Scope

In scope: **M3 `ExchangeAdapter` port** (`exchange/base/ports.py` — `MarketDataPort`, `TradingPort`
structural types and the `ExchangeCapabilities` record), **M4 Bybit adapter**
(`exchange/bybit/` — REST + public/private WS, signing, error mapping), **M5 in-process bus**
(`bus/bus.py`, topic contract), and **M6 ingestion** (`ingestion/` — `ConnectionManager`,
`SubscriptionPlanner`, `Heartbeat/Watchdog`, `ReconnectPolicy`, `Normalizer`, `SequenceTracker`,
`RestClient`, `ClockGuard`), together with the downstream write paths into QuestDB (klines, ticks) and
Postgres (`instruments`, `instrument_versions`), and the fixture capture/replay ingress used by
`packages/fixtures` and `tests/fixtures/bybit/`.

Out of scope (per ticket "Out of scope" section, restated so this document is self-contained):
auth/RBAC and session threats (`E09-X01`), key-vault storage and permission verification (E27),
OMS/order-path threats (E29), supply-chain/dependency threats (E03, referenced as an adjacent model),
the client-side WS gateway (E17, boundary named but not modelled here), and executing the adversarial
tests (`E08-X02`) or configuring scanners (`E08-X03`) — this document defines what those verify.

Trading-capability threats (`TradingPort`, order placement, native SL) are named only where the
ingestion path could reach them by capability creep (STRIDE "Elevation of privilege", §3.6); the order
path's own threat surface belongs to E29 and is not re-derived here.

## 2. Data-flow diagram

Trust boundaries follow `04-security-program.md` §4 (TB-1..TB-9), specifically TB-7 (backend → Bybit).
This diagram is the exchange-boundary detail behind TB-7 and adds the M3–M6 internal boundaries the
programme-level diagram does not show.

Elements analysed below (§3): DNS resolution, the live/demo REST hosts, the public/private WS hosts, the
request signer, `RestClient`, `ConnectionManager`/`Normalizer` (M4), the `ExchangeAdapter` port and
`ExchangeCapabilities` record (M3), `SequenceTracker`/`ClockGuard`/`SubscriptionPlanner`/`ReconnectPolicy`
(M6), the bus, QuestDB/Postgres write paths, the downstream read surface (named only), and the fixture
capture/replay path. Every element and every labelled flow above has at least one row in §3, or an
explicit "not applicable" note.

## 3. STRIDE analysis

Table shape follows `04-security-program.md` §5 (`T` id, STRIDE category, threat, L, I, Risk, mitigations,
residual), extended with a **Verify** column naming the test/metric that proves the mitigation — a row
with no verification is itself a finding (flagged `[FINDING]`). Threat ids keep the `W*` prefix from §5.5
(WebSocket ingestion & fan-out) where a §5.5 threat is being re-derived against the concrete E08-T01
design; new ids introduced by this deeper pass use an `E8*` prefix so they don't collide with §5.5's
existing `W1`–`W11` (which cover fan-out/gateway concerns partially out of this ticket's scope) or with
the exchange-API-key `K*` series (§5.1, referenced not re-derived).

### 3.6 Elevation of privilege

The market-data path (M3–M6) is intentionally read-only. The threat here is **capability creep**: a
trading-capable key or a `TradingPort` call becoming reachable from the ingestion path.

## 5. Control mapping and gaps

Every threat above names a mitigating SR id and/or a specific code-level construct plus its test. Where
an existing programme-level SR (§5.5 W-series, §6.2 SR-030..SR-040b) already covers a threat, the row
re-derives it against the E08-T01 concrete design rather than re-numbering it. New, design-specific
constructs introduced by this pass (E8-1..E8-32) do not yet have formal `SR-1xx` numbers reserved in
`04-security-program.md` §6; the follow-up items below route each to either a formal SR-number docs PR
or a new/existing E08 ticket:

| No mitigation row in §3 is left without a named verification test; where the test does not yet exist in the repo, its intended name is given so `E08-T*`/`E08-Q*` implementers create exactly that test | `E08-T02`..`E08-T0N` (adapter/ingestion implementation tickets), `E08-Q02`/`E08-Q03` (contract/integration test tickets)     |

## 5a. Enforcing controls (E08-X03)

`E08-X03` converts three of the mitigations above from claims into automated CI gates. Each rule lives
in `.semgrep/` (with a true-positive/true-negative fixture under `.semgrep/tests/`, checked by
`tools/ci/check_semgrep_rule_tests.py`) and runs in the `security` lane (`.github/workflows/_job-security.yml`,
`semgrep` job) on every PR touching `exchange/`, `ingestion/` or `bus/` (the lane's existing `js`/`py`/`infra`
path filters already cover these paths; see `pr.yml`).

Secret-scanning (gitleaks, `.gitleaks.toml`) and the fixture pre-commit check
(`packages/fixtures/scripts/verify.mjs`) additionally carry Bybit-specific patterns
(`bybit-api-key`, `bybit-hmac-signature`, `bybit-bapi-header`) so a captured fixture containing an
`X-BAPI-*` header or a signature cannot be committed.

## 6. Residual-risk register update

**RSK-011** (ingestion drops under volatility bursts — R2). This model does not retire either — both
remain live and are refined by this pass:

- **RSK-010** — description extended by E8-6 (silent-patch-across-gap explicitly forbidden by
  construction, not just by review) and E8-7 (crossed-book invariant treated as equivalent to a gap).
  No score change (still Critical, L3×I5) — these are refinements of the same root cause the register
  already names, not a new risk class.
- **RSK-011** — description extended by E8-26 (bounded-queue backpressure verified per topic-class, book
  deltas resnapshot rather than drop) and E8-24/E8-25 (rate-limit exhaustion is a distinct availability
  failure mode from message-loss-under-burst, tracked here as a sibling concern under the same
  ingestion-availability umbrella). No score change.
- **New entry proposed:** none. E8-19/E8-22/E8-23 (credential-leakage-via-the-adapter-path) are bounded
  by, and do not exceed, the existing K-series (§5.1) blast radius already captured for key-secret
  disclosure via logs/traces (K1) — adding a duplicate RSK entry would double-count that scenario.
  E8-30/E8-31 (capability creep) are new _controls_, not a new _risk_: the underlying risk (a
  trading-capable path reachable where it shouldn't be) is already the subject of RSK-016 ("An order
  reaches the exchange without a native stop-loss") and O-series threats (§5.2); if the Architect/epic
  review (§7) disagrees, a new RSK id should be drafted in a follow-up PR per the register's own
  change process (`32-risk-register.md` §11), to avoid breaking its invariant ID immutability inline here.

## 7. Review session record

_(To be completed at the scheduled review with the Architect and epic owner — this section is left as
the template the session fills in, per the ticket's Definition of Done. This PR delivers the model for
that review; it does not itself constitute the review. Per the ticket's "re-reviewed when the design
changes" scenario, this model is also revisited when `E08-K01`'s depth-tier ADR lands and before R0 exit.)_

- Date:
- Attendees: Architect, Epic owner (E08), Security engineer (author)
- Comments:
- Confirmed: the DFD's boundary between M3-M6 and the code layout under `services/api/candleviewer/`
  matches (validated per §3's "does the boundary in the diagram exist in the package structure?" test
  plan item).
- Risk-register changes confirmed: RSK-010, RSK-011 refined per §6.
- Security-engineer sign-off: pending this session.

## 8. Observability — detection signal per threat

Every threat in §3 names its detection signal inline in the "Verify" column where that signal is a
metric or alert (e.g. `ingest_queue_full_total`, `bybit_clock_drift_ms`, `bybit_reconnect_total`). Threats
whose only current signal is a test (not a runtime metric/alert) are monitoring gaps, listed here for
`E08-T06` (alerting ticket) to close:

| Threat                                       | Current signal                | Gap                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| E8-9 (instrument filter tampering/staleness) | None at runtime — only a test | Needs a metric comparing the currently-referenced `instrument_versions` row age against a max-staleness budget                  |
| E8-17 / E8-10 (fixture provenance)           | CI lint only                  | No runtime signal needed — dev/CI-time control, explicitly out of the runtime alerting scope                                    |
| E8-28 (symbol-thrash subscription churn)     | None at runtime — only a test | Needs a `subscription_churn_total` counter so an operator sees thrash before it becomes a W6-adjacent reconnect-storm precursor |

Every other threat row's "Verify" column doubles as its detection signal (metric or structured log
event); none of the remaining rows are monitoring gaps.
