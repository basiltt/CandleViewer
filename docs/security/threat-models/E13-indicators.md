# E13 — STRIDE threat model: Indicator framework, presets and metric exposure

- Ticket: E13-X01 (issue #428). Owner: Security engineer (CODEOWNER). Status: **Draft** for Security + Architect +
  chart-engine lead review. Accepted risks (§12) await Owner sign-off.
- Method: `docs/plan/04-security-program.md` §5 template (L x I = risk), STRIDE per element (C-12.1). Format mirrors
  `E12-bars.md`. Reuses E09 (auth/RBAC), E12 (bars, the input of every kernel), E17 (WS envelope) and E35 (rule
  engine) controls; those threats are **referenced, not duplicated**.
- Inputs: ADR-0034 (**Proposed**, merged in #2050) and `docs/plan/spikes/e13-o4.md` (E13-K01 #348, closed).
  Everything taken from ADR-0034 (9 `server` / 19 `client_worker` split, bit-for-bit parity, banned `pow/exp/log`,
  retention-windowed worker memory) is cited as _proposed_ and is a control only once the ADR is ratified and
  E13-T04 finalises it.
- Path note: the ticket names `e13-indicators.md` under `docs/security/threat-models/`; this file follows the
  merged precedent (`E12-bars.md`) and the GOV-008 scan directory.
- **Data classification.** Market data (public). Presentation preferences — preset `params`/`style`, names,
  favourites (user-private, not secret). **The moment a rule or a stop offset consumes an indicator value, that
  value becomes safety-relevant** (§5): ATR feeds `sl_offset_unit="atr"` (`24-internal-schemas.md`, account
  profile: `sl_atr_period`, `sl_atr_multiple`) and confirmed Zig Zag `swing_high`/`swing_low` can feed
  structure-based trailing stops. The "indicators are cosmetics" assumption is therefore false for the `server`
  set, and this model treats the metric-integrity boundary as the headline concern.
- **Headline:** (1) integrity of any indicator value that reaches a rule or stop (O1, O8 of
  `04-security-program.md`); (2) broken object-level authorization on user presets; (3) authenticated users
  scheduling backend compute and storing unbounded JSONB. Generic web threats stay with E09/E17.
- Gate note: enumerates weaknesses only; no credentials or hosts appear.

## 1. Scope

In scope: the five data flows named by the ticket — browser <-> `GET /indicators` (`listIndicators`); browser <->
`/indicator-presets` CRUD (E13-T03); kernel -> `MetricRegistry` -> rule/alert consumers (E13-T02, E13-S08);
worker mirror -> display (E13-T01); `WorkspaceBundle.indicator_presets` import/export. Also: `compute: server`
subscriptions, the S08 referencing-objects guard, VWAP anchors (E13-S07), and the Zig Zag `provisional` contract
(E13-S05).

Out of scope: the rule engine's own model (E35, `e35-rule-engine.md`) and OMS / fan-out (E29/E34) — this model
**hands off the metric-integrity boundary** to them explicitly (§5); E13-X02 executes abuse cases; penetration
testing (E43, pre-R4); E15 workspace persistence beyond the bundle's `indicator_presets` array.

Text description: an authenticated client reads the catalogue and renders forms from its server-supplied
`params_schema` (F1-F2). It saves, edits and imports presets whose `params`/`style` are free JSON until the server
validates them (F3-F6). The authoritative kernel (P3) reads closed bars, memoises per `(symbol, spec_hash,
params)` and publishes **confirmed** values to the registry for rules (F9) and ATR to stop sizing (F10). The
worker (P5) computes its own display copy from client bars (F11-F12) and **never** feeds F9/F10. The client can
also schedule `compute: server` work (F13) and ask to delete an indicator that rules reference (F14-F15).

Elements: external entities **E1-E3**; processes **P1-P3, P5-P8** (P4 folded into E2); stores **DS1-DS4**; flows
**F1-F15**. Every element appears in §4 (coverage matrix 4.7).

Boundaries: **TB-4** (F1, F3, F5, F13, F14: authenticated, RBAC-scoped by E09; the client enforces nothing).
**Internal store boundary** (F4, F8). **TB-8** (this model's name for the F9/F10 hand-off to E35/E29/E34: only
values that are `server`-computed, closed-bar and non-provisional may cross it).

## 3. Numeric bounds: contract today, and recommended values

Measured inputs (E13-K01, `spikes/e13-o4.md`; E13-Q03 re-measures on reference hardware): worker full compute at
100k bars worst case 14.8 ms (Ichimoku), ten active indicators 86.1 ms; incremental 0.12 us per closed bar worst
case; worker output memory 46.5 MiB for 61 f64 series x 100k (cap 8 MB shared); **Python scalar (server) kernel
full compute at 100k bars up to 496 ms (Ichimoku) and 333 ms (VWAP + 3 sigma)**, i.e. 30-40x the worker.
The server cost is the DoS lever: a full recompute is O(bars x instances), the incremental path is O(1).
Every bound is validated **before** any allocation, subscription or compute is scheduled; truncation afterwards is
not a control. Values are **proposals** for E13-T02/T03/T01/S08 and E13-Q03 to confirm; they are not settled.

Cross-check against budgets (6 `06-performance-and-load-standard.md` §4.3: <= 2 ms/frame indicator redraw; first
visible window <= 250 ms at 100k): 20 instances at the measured worst-case 14.8 ms full compute stays near 300 ms
worker CPU off the main thread, and the caps leave every documented legitimate path intact. The server cap of 8 per
user x 0.5 s worst-case full recompute bounds one user to ~4 s of single-core work per refresh storm, which the
2-recompute executor then serialises. The numbers are starting values; E13-Q03 must confirm them on reference
hardware before E13-T02/T03 freeze them (Python measurements here are 3.14 local; CI on 3.12 is authoritative).

## 4. STRIDE table

Risk = L x I (Low/Med/High). Disposition: **M** mitigated by a named ticket, **A** accepted (Owner sign-off
recorded in §12), **R** referenced (owned by another epic's model), **N/A** with a reason. Verification layers
follow `04-security-program.md`: unit, integration, contract, load, manual-review; adversarial cases go to
E13-X02 (executes §9) and E13-Q06 (black-box). Provenance of every control is tagged in §11. Row ids are `IR-nn`.
Data flows: **DF1** catalogue (F1-F2), **DF2** presets CRUD (F3-F4), **DF3** kernel -> registry -> consumers
(F7-F10, F13-F15), **DF4** worker mirror -> display (F11-F12), **DF5** bundle import/export (F5-F6).

### 4.1 Spoofing

| -- | -------------- | ------ | - | - | ---- | ------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| IR-01 | DF2, P2, F3 | Read, update or delete another user's preset by guessing its UUID (BOLA); `GET /indicator-presets` list leaks other users' rows | M | M | Medium | `x-rbac scope: self`; every query is `owner_user_id = :principal OR owner_user_id IS NULL` (reads) / `= :principal` (writes), enforced in the repository, not the router; foreign id returns **404** (not 403) so existence is not an oracle; authorization denial logged (SR-050, SR-051) | E13-T03 | integration, contract | M |
| IR-02 | DF2, DS1 | Non-owner mutates or deletes a built-in (`owner_user_id IS NULL`), or a user claims a built-in as theirs | M | M | Medium | built-ins immutable at the service layer (write path rejects `owner IS NULL`); "customise" copies into a user-owned row; `is_builtin` and `owner_user_id` are server-managed and never read from the body (IR-10) | E13-T03 | integration, contract | M |
| IR-03 | DF1, F2 | Spoofed catalogue response (network adversary) injects a hostile `params_schema` | L | M | Low | TLS on the tailnet/loopback (SR-049, TB-4); catalogue is code-defined (DS4), not user-writable; renderer subset (SR-E13-09) is defence in depth | E09 / E13-T02 | review | R |
| IR-04 | DF4, P5 | A worker/renderer-computed value is presented to a consumer as if it were the kernel's (display value posing as authoritative metric) | M | H | **High** | the registry has **no client write path**: no REST/WS frame accepts a metric value; F9/F10 originate only in P3; the worker has no import edge into `orderflow`/`risk` (import-linter, C-3.1); see §5 | E13-T02, E13-S08 | unit, integration, review | M |
| IR-05 | DF3, P8, F13 | Subscribe to, or unsubscribe, another user's server-compute subscription by id | L | L | Low | subscriptions are connection- and principal-bound; ids never accepted from the client for another principal (E17) | E13-T02 | integration | R |
| IR-06 | DF5, F5 | Bundle sets `owner_user_id` of another user or of NULL (built-in) on an imported preset | M | M | Medium | import ignores/rejects owner fields; owner is always the session principal; `is_builtin` forced false (IR-10) | E13-T03 | contract, integration | M |

| IR-11 | DF3, F9 | A **provisional** Zig Zag swing (last unconfirmed leg, repaints) is published to the registry and a rule/stop acts on a leg that later disappears | M | H | **High** | E13-S05: the kernel does **not** publish provisional values into the registry at all; `provisional=true` on the worker channel only; E35 adds its own assertion (RE-series); named test lives in E13-S05 and is asserted again by E13-X02 AC-11 | E13-S05, E35 | unit, integration | M |
| IR-12 | DF3, DF4, F10 | A worker-computed (display-only) value is used where the authoritative kernel value is required — specifically ATR feeding `sl_offset_unit="atr"` | M | H | **Critical** | see §5: ATR for stop sizing is read only from the `server` kernel via `MetricRegistry.resolve()`; worker ATR is display-only; test `test_atr_stop_offset_source_is_kernel` (E13-S08) plus a static check that `risk`/`oms` import no chart-engine contract; owner decision recorded in §12 | E13-T02, E13-S08, E29 | unit, integration, static | M |

| IR-15 | DF3, F9 | A user-chosen display name (SCR-036) such as `atr(14, 5m)` collides with, or is mistaken for, a metric key | M | M | Medium | metric key derives from the T01 instance key, never the display name (E13-S08); duplicates get an ordinal; picker shows key + source | E13-S08 | unit, e2e | M |
| IR-16 | DF3, F14 | Referential-guard bypass: client-only check, or a race between the guard check and a rule being armed, deletes an indicator an armed rule uses | M | H | **High** | guard is server-authoritative and checked inside the same transaction/lock that arming takes; save-time resolution fails closed (unresolvable key rejects, never runtime-skips) | E13-S08, E35 | integration | M |
| IR-17 | DF3, F7 | Kernel consumes wrong/forming/backfill-overwritten bars (E12 BR-06/07/08) so the indicator is silently wrong | L | H | Medium | rule-facing values use **closed** bars only; integrity of bars is E12's (`E12-bars.md`) | E12 | integration | R |

## 5. The safety-relevant path: ATR -> stop offset, and provisional swings

Stated explicitly, as the ticket requires:

1. **ATR feeds `sl_offset_unit="atr"`.** The per-account profile (`24-internal-schemas.md`, `sl_offset_unit`
   in `ticks|percent|r_multiple|atr`, `sl_atr_period=14`, `sl_atr_multiple=2.0`, and `tp_offset_unit`) sizes a
   protective stop from an ATR value. The native stop-loss invariant (C-2.6, SR-056) means that stop is the only
   protection of a live position; a wrong ATR is a wrong stop distance on real money.
2. **A display-only worker value must never be the source for a stop offset.** ATR for stop sizing is read **only**
   from the authoritative backend kernel (M9, `compute: server`) through `MetricRegistry.resolve(name, scope)`,
   from **closed** bars. The worker copy (E13-T01) is a display mirror; no code path, request field, WS frame or
   persisted preset lets a client-supplied number become `sl_atr_*` input (SR-052: client values are hints;
   sizing is server-side). C-2.16 already keeps the engine exchange- and network-free, so it cannot be an input
   source; this model adds the explicit negative requirement and a test.
3. **Control and owning test.** Control: SR-E13-11 (single authoritative source, registry-only read, closed bars,
   no client write path). Owning tests: `test_atr_stop_offset_source_is_kernel` (E13-S08: stop sizing reads the
   registry; a worker-only ATR with a deliberately different value must not change the offset) and the E13-Q05
   parity pack (kernel == worker on the recorded window, so a divergence is detected before it is relied on).
   E13-X02 AC-10 re-executes it adversarially. Static: import-linter keeps `risk`/`oms` free of any chart-engine
   contract (C-3.1), and E13-X02/X03 may add a Semgrep rule if a pattern emerges.
4. **Zig Zag.** Confirmed `swing_high`/`swing_low` may feed structure-based trailing stops; the provisional leg
   must not. Control: E13-S05 does not publish provisional values into the registry at all (source exclusion);
   E35 asserts it again at evaluation (defence in depth). A non-confirmed swing reaching a rule is IR-11.
5. **Parity as a security signal.** On a rule-eligible metric a parity mismatch means the chart and the rule use
   different numbers. `indicator_parity_mismatch_total{indicator}` is therefore an **ERROR-level** security-adjacent
   event, not only a bug (§10). It does not itself stop trading; the kernel value stays authoritative.
6. **Hand-off.** What a rule does with a value (hysteresis, staleness, ineligible-metric rejection, firing log) is
   E35; how a stop is sized and submitted is E29/E34. E13 guarantees only: closed, confirmed, kernel-sourced,
   versioned values at the registry boundary (TB-8). If any of E13's guarantees is weakened the E35/E29 models must
   be re-opened (§12).

## 6. Classification and elevation of privilege

- **Public:** OHLCV bars, trades-derived series, the catalogue (descriptors, `params_schema`, defaults).
- **User-private (not secret):** preset names, `params`, `style`, favourites, bundle `indicator_presets`.
  Compromise of these discloses a trading style, not a credential. Not confidential enough for field encryption;
  must still be scoped to the owner (IR-01, IR-26).
- **Safety-relevant (integrity-critical):** any registry value consumed by a rule, alert action or stop-offset
  profile; kernel `build_version`; the provisional flag. Needs integrity controls, not confidentiality.
- **Re-classification trigger:** a per-user derived series that encodes account data (PnL-, position- or
  size-based indicators) would make indicator output account-scoped and re-open I rows and RBAC scope; indicators
  with `inputs` beyond bars/trades require a model amendment.
- No privileged operation exists in E13. Owner has no special E13 power except seeing other users' referencing
  object names (IR-23); there are no admin overrides, no key material and no order path.

## 7. Controls, constants and drift prevention

- Constants live in one backend module (`candleviewer/orderflow/indicators/limits.py`, owner E13-T02) and one
  TS counterpart generated or asserted against it (no hand-copied numbers); a unit test pins every value and the
  contract test asserts the OpenAPI `maxLength`/`minimum`/`maximum` match.
- Contract drift to fix in the contract-first PR (C-6.1) before consumers: `IndicatorPresetInput` has no
  `style`/`pane_target`/`is_favourite` yet the table has them; `additionalProperties: true` on `params`;
  `indicator_code` `maxLength: 40` vs DB 32; example uses `atr_trail` (not a v1 code); `is_default` vs
  `is_favourite`. These are IR-08/IR-10 and are requested on E13-T03 (§11).
- Requirement ids reused: SR-006, SR-040, SR-044, SR-049, SR-050, SR-051, SR-052, SR-056, SR-060, SR-062, SR-065.
  New ids `SR-E13-01..11` below are local to this model (they are proposals; the SR registry in 04-security-program
  is amended only by its owner).

| SR-E13-10 | Worker retention window formula; `indicator_output_bytes{where}` | IR-38 | E13-T01 |
| SR-E13-11 | Stop sizing/rules read only the kernel via the registry, closed bars, no client write path | IR-04, 12 | E13-T02, E13-S08 |

## 8. Cross-references and shared mechanism

- E09 `e09-auth-rbac.md`: session, RBAC (`workspaces:*`, `marketdata:read`), IDOR test pattern (IR-01, IR-40).
- E12 `E12-bars.md`: bar integrity (IR-17) and the 250 000-bar figure reused by SR-E13-04.
- E17 (WS envelope, backpressure) for IR-05, IR-39. E35 `e35-rule-engine.md` for rule-side metric validation
  and provisional exclusion; E29/E34 for stop sizing. E15 for workspace persistence. E07 for storage.
- `04-security-program.md` §8.2 audit catalogue: the `indicator_preset.*` events are a candidate addition.

## 9. Abuse cases (handed to E13-X02 execution and E13-Q06 black-box)

Each case is executable as written. "A" and "B" are two seeded users with `workspaces:write`; "V" is a
read-only role. IDs are fixtures the test creates. Observation = the HTTP status/body and the named metric/log.

## 10. Observability signals

- Preset access: authorization-denial log (principal, preset id, route) and `indicator_preset_denied_total`.
- `indicator_subscriptions` (per-user bucketed gauge, no user-id label) and `indicator_cap_rejected_total{cap}` for
  SR-E13-02/03/04/07.
- `indicator_compute_seconds{indicator,where}`, `indicator_output_bytes{where}` (ADR-0034, proposed).
- **`indicator_parity_mismatch_total{indicator}`**: ERROR-level; any non-zero value for a rule-eligible indicator
  pages (security-adjacent: chart and rule disagree).
- `indicator_provisional_published_total` must be 0 forever: a tripwire for IR-11 (counter incremented by a
  defensive assertion in the registry publisher, which also refuses the publish).
- Audit/analytics events `indicator_preset.*` (IR-19).

| E13-T03 | `params`/`style` validation and size caps `[ticket body]` (numbers 4 KiB/depth 4/64 keys, SR-E13-06, required by this model); owner-scoped repository, 404 on foreign id (IR-01); built-in immutability `[ticket body]`; `extra="forbid"` and server-managed `is_builtin`/`owner_user_id` (IR-10); `indicator_code` registry membership and `maxLength` 32 / example fix (IR-08); 500 presets, bundle 200/1 MiB atomic import (SR-E13-07); audit events `indicator_preset.*` (IR-19): items after the first two are `required by this model - not yet in the ticket` |
| E13-T04 | Finalises ADR-0034 (Proposed); records that the SR-E13-xx limits and the metric-integrity boundary are consequences; parity wording unchanged |
| E13-S01 | Closed JSON Schema subset renderer, null-prototype parsing of params (SR-E13-09, IR-14, IR-37): `required by this model - not yet in the ticket`; instance/sub-pane cap UX |
| E13-S02 | No control of its own; consumes SR-E13-01 bounds for period params |
| E13-S03 | Sub-pane creation counts against the 6-pane cap (IR-32); no other control |
| E13-S04 | **ATR is the stop-sizing indicator**: ATR kernel is `server`, `exact`, closed bars (IR-12); no other control |
| E13-S05 | Provisional Zig Zag never published to the registry `[ticket body]` (IR-11); tripwire counter and defensive publisher assertion: `required by this model - not yet in the ticket` |
| E13-S06 | No control; `volume`/`cvd` are `server`, same caps |
| E13-S07 | `custom_ts` anchor range check (SR-E13-05, IR-34): `required by this model - not yet in the ticket`; same kernel as E14 |
| E13-S08 | Server-authoritative referential guard `[ticket body]` run in the arming lock/transaction (IR-16); owner-filtered referencing list (IR-23); metric key independent of display name `[ticket body]` (IR-15); `test_atr_stop_offset_source_is_kernel` (SR-E13-11, IR-12): items after the first are `required by this model - not yet in the ticket` |
| E13-K01 | Spike delivered ADR-0034 (Proposed) and the measured costs used in §3; no control of its own |
| E13-Q01 | Black-box plan: consumes AC-01..AC-22 and the §3 boundary table; no control of its own |
| E13-Q02 | Playwright: AC-14 (caps in UI); forbidden-role UI behaviour |
| E13-Q03 | Confirms every §3 number on reference hardware before T02/T03 freeze them; executes AC-15; closes the Electron measurement |
| E13-Q04 | Accessibility audit: no security control |
| E13-Q05 | Parity pack; executes AC-21; asserts `indicator_parity_mismatch_total` behaviour (IR-13) |
| E13-Q06 | Black-box execution of AC-08, AC-12, AC-14, AC-15, AC-22 and chaos; QA sign-off |
| E13-X01 | This model |
| E13-X02 | Executes AC-01..AC-20 (§9) and verifies each control row; CI/Semgrep rules where a pattern emerges; sign-off |
| E13-D01 / D02 / D03 | Design: no control; copy for rejection messages names the bound (IR-07) |
| E13-D04 | Closed token-name list that SR-E13-08 validates against: `[ticket body]` in T03; palette tokens are the allowed value set |
| E13-D05 / D06 / D07 | Design: no control; D07 must check that cap and rejection states exist |
| E09 / E12 / E15 / E17 / E29 / E34 / E35 | Referenced controls: IR-01/40 (E09), IR-17 (E12), IR-43 (E15), IR-05/39 (E17), IR-12/20 (E29/E34), IR-11/20/42 (E35) |

New obligations (not yet posted): requested scope additions on E13-T01 (#425), E13-T02 (#426), E13-T03 (#427),
E13-S01 (#423), E13-S05 (#462), E13-S07 (#464) and E13-S08 (#465). If a ticket owner rejects a number, the number
in §3 must be amended here in the same PR that changes the ticket.

## 12. Residual risks, review and sign-off

- Accepted (awaiting Owner sign-off): IR-18 (trusted-host DB edit of presentation data), IR-27 (memo shared
  across users; derived from public data).
- **Residual (not eliminated):**
  - IR-12 (ATR source) and IR-11 (provisional swing) are mitigated at the **source** by E13; whether a stop or a
    rule actually reads only the registry is enforced in E29/E34/E35 and by the named test. Inherent
    Critical/High, residual Medium once `test_atr_stop_offset_source_is_kernel` and E35's assertion exist;
    until E13-S08 lands there is no control, so E13-S08 must not be merged without it. Tracked as **RSK-060**.
  - IR-13/IR-20: parity is proven on recorded and synthetic data only; a platform libm difference in a future
    kernel (`pow/exp/log`, banned) would break it. ADR-0034 is Proposed.
  - IR-29..IR-34, 38: all caps are starting values and unmeasured on reference hardware (E13-Q03); a user at
    the per-user caps on a hot symbol still costs real CPU. Tracked as **RSK-061**.
- No High residual is unmitigated or un-owned. Items to watch: IR-12, IR-16, IR-30 (depend on tickets not yet
  built and on a Proposed ADR).
- Status is **Draft**: the Owner accepts the risks in §12 (agent-delivery adaptation); the Security-engineer
  sign-off is a PR comment by the independent security reviewer; Architect and chart-engine lead review via PR
  review. E13-T02, T03 and S08 must not start before both.
