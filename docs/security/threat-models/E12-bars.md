# E12 — STRIDE threat model: Bar builders, backfill and the `bars` topic

- Ticket: E12-X01 (issue #346). Owner: Security engineer (CODEOWNER). Status: Draft for Security + Architect review.
- Method: `docs/plan/04-security-program.md` §5 template (L x I = risk), STRIDE per epic (C-12.1). Reuses the
  exchange-boundary trust model of E08 (`e08-exchange-boundary.md`, W1-W11), the E08 ingestion controls
  (frame guard and print rejection, #1898; priority lanes, #1957) and the storage model of E07
  (`E07-storage.md`); those threats are **referenced, not duplicated**. Format mirrors `E22-big-trades.md`.
- Path note: the ticket names `docs/plan/security/threat-models/e12-bars.md`. Every merged model (E07, E22, E24,
  E25, E08, E09, E16, E35, E49) lives under `docs/security/threat-models/` and GOV-008
  (`scripts/check_threat_model_ticket_map.py`) only scans that directory, so this model follows the precedent
  location and is named `E12-bars.md`.
- **Data classification: public market data only.** Bars are aggregates of public prints and public klines.
  No secrets, no PII, no account or key material, no per-user data except the user's own chart settings
  (E12-S12, not modelled here beyond a pointer). That classification is what justifies the light controls below;
  per-user recorded data or account-scoped tape would **invalidate it** and re-open §6.
- **Headline:** E12 moves no money and holds no keys, so its real security property is **integrity of
  evidence** (`04-security-program.md` O8). A tampered or quietly wrong bar is an input to footprint, profiles,
  CVD, replay, the journal and, later, rule conditions that place live orders (E35). Availability of the
  user-controlled `bar_type`/`param`/window surface is the second concern. The generic web threats are handled
  by E09 and E17 and are only referenced.
- Gate note: this file enumerates weaknesses only; no credentials or hosts appear.
- ADR-0033 (PR #1968) is **Proposed**, not Accepted. Everything this model takes from it (generation-pointer
  rebuild, cancellation token, 250 000-bar cap, bounded 2-worker executor, `bar_rebuild_busy`) is cited as
  _proposed_ and is a control only once the ADR is ratified and E12-S12 lands it.

## 1. Scope

In scope: Bybit `publicTrade` (E08) -> normaliser -> bus -> M8 `BarBuilderSet` (E12-T03) with the six builders
(E12-S01..S04) -> write path into QuestDB `bars_*` (E12-T02, `21-database-schema.md` §4.8) and Parquet cold
tier (E07) -> read helpers -> REST `GET /market/klines` and `GET /market/bars` (E12-T05) and WS
`bars.{symbol}.{bar_type}.{param}` (E12-T06, `23-ws-protocol.md` §6.1/§14.3) -> chart engine (E12-S06..S11).
Also in scope: the Bybit REST kline backfill (E12-S05), builder-state snapshot blobs (E12-T03), the in-process
`BarSpec`/`spec_hash` model and wire mapping (E12-T01, merged in #1906) and the proposed rebuild path
(ADR-0033 / E12-S12). Test-only probe and diagnostics surfaces (`SCR-046`, E12-Q03 probe) are in scope for
the production-reachability check only.

Out of scope: executing abuse cases (E12-X02), writing SAST/DAST rules (E12-X03), auth/session/RBAC design
(E09), key handling (E27), WS envelope, handshake and backpressure mechanics (E17; this model covers the
`bars` topic's _use_ of them), recorder retention execution (E16), pen-testing.

Text description of the diagram (the diagram is not the only carrier): Public trades enter from Bybit across
**TB-7**, are validated by the E08 ingestion boundary, and reach the bar builders over the in-process bus.
Builders emit `BarUpdate`s to a write path that persists rows into QuestDB across the **internal store
boundary** (F7, F8, F10, F11, F13 all cross it). A separate backfill client pulls klines across TB-7 and writes
kline-sourced rows through the same write path. The authenticated client reaches the REST endpoints and the WS
gateway across **TB-4**; it supplies `bar_type`, `param`, `from`, `to`, `limit`, `history` and rebuild
requests, all of which are hostile input. The server never trusts the client for anything it renders.

Elements for the per-element STRIDE enumeration (§4): external entities **E1, E2, E3**; processes **P1-P7**;
data stores **DS1-DS5**; flows **F1-F17**. Every element and flow appears in at least one row of §4 (the
coverage matrix at the end of §4 lists where).

Boundaries: **TB-7** (F1, F5: all upstream content untrusted; E08 and #1898 own frame and print plausibility,
E12 adds only what is specific to bars: kline-vs-tape source precedence and kline response validation).
**TB-4** (F12, F14, F17: authenticated and RBAC-scoped by E09; the client is trusted to enforce nothing).
**Internal store boundary** (F7, F8, F10, F11, F13: QuestDB, Parquet and blob files are on the trusted host but
are a distinct integrity domain; writers must be only the bars write path, and readers must treat a row's
`build_version` and `spec_hash` as claims to verify, not facts). F2-F4, F9, F15 are in-process or loopback.

## 3. Numeric bounds: contract today, and recommended values

Every bound must be enforced by validation **before** any query, allocation, subscription or rebuild is created;
truncation after the fact is not a control (budget #13: API read p95 < 150 ms). The recommended values are
proposals for E12-T05/T06/T03/S12 and for the `E12-X03` rules to assert. Constants live in one module
(`candleviewer/bars/limits.py`, named in the map in §11) with an assert test that pins each value.

Cross-check against performance budgets (#5 builder throughput, #11 WS fan-out, #13 API read p95): the
caps above leave every documented legitimate path intact. The 250 000-bar figure is the ADR-0033 prototype
cap (rebuild of 1M prints measured at 0.82-1.05 s on the quiet-machine baseline, 83-106 MB peak RSS), so a
rebuild at the cap is well inside the 10 s rebuild budget even at the 2x slowdown note in the ADR. The
31 d non-time window is the smallest value that still lets a user fill the chart default of 1 000 bars on
every supported parameter at typical liquidity; it is a starting value and `E12-Q05` must confirm it against
real tape density before E12-T05 freezes it.

## 4. STRIDE table

Risk = L x I (Low/Med/High). Disposition: **M** mitigated by a named ticket, **A** accepted (Owner sign-off
recorded in §12), **R** referenced (owned and mitigated by another epic's model). Verification layers follow
`04-security-program.md`: unit, integration, contract, load, manual-review; adversarial cases go to E12-X02,
static enforcement to E12-X03, availability to E12-Q05/Q06. Provenance of every control is tagged in §11.
Element ids are from §2. Row ids are `BR-nn`.

## 5. Evidence-integrity chain, end to end

The T and R rows (BR-06..BR-20) matter most, so the chain is stated once. A served bar is trustworthy when
all of the following hold, and each link names the control that keeps it true:

1. **Input is plausible** (E08 frame guard and print rejection, #1898; BR-01, BR-11).
2. **Input is ordered and unique** (E08 dedup; BR-06).
3. **The builder is a pure function of that input** and of a `spec_hash` (merged #1906; golden vectors;
   E12-Q02, E12-T04; BR-06, BR-15).
4. **The write is the only write** (single writer, no synthetic rows, source precedence; BR-05, BR-07, BR-08).
5. **History only changes through a visible, attributable event** (`build_version` bump, generation swap,
   audit record; BR-09, BR-18).
6. **The response says what produced it** (`build_version`, `spec_hash`, `meta.sources`,
   `recording_started_at`, null-not-zero delta; BR-10, BR-17, BR-07).
7. **The reader can detect a post-write edit** (row checksum; BR-08).

A break at any link is a High-impact event, which is why every T/R row has a verification layer and an
observability signal in §10. Exactness: `Bar` is exact (`Decimal`); the DOUBLE column is a storage
representation, so the **parity test compares at stored precision** and never claims bit-exact equality with the
model (BR-14).

## 6. Classification and elevation of privilege

**Classification: public market data only.** Bars are aggregates of public prints and public klines. The only
per-user data adjacent to E12 is `chart_settings.bar_mode` (E12-S12, Postgres), which holds a bar type and a
parameter and is scoped to the caller by session. No secret, key, account id, order or PII enters any E12
store, frame, log line or metric label. Consequences:

- Light controls are proportionate: `marketdata:read` with scope none is the right permission (BR-21, BR-22).
- This classification is a **precondition**, not a fact to assume. Account-scoped tape (e.g. "my fills as bars"),
  per-user recorded data or any private stream feeding a builder **invalidates this model**; the D-rows and the
  I-rows must then be re-derived and the model re-reviewed before the ticket is Ready.

**Elevation of privilege (BR-39, BR-40): none expected, and why.** E12 introduces no order, key, account, role
or admin operation. Every route and the topic need only `marketdata:read`. The one state-changing operation is a
user rebuilding **their own** requested series (proposed, ADR-0033), which creates server-side data derived from
public tape and is scoped and rate-limited (SR-E12-05/06). Re-open conditions, to be checked at E12-X04 and by
any ticket that touches these: (a) an admin or Owner "rebuild all", "force `build_version`" or "purge bars"
action; (b) a rule-engine condition that consumes bars and places orders (E35 owns that model, but it must
state that bar integrity is its input assumption); (c) any new bar type with a new parameter shape (§8
maintenance note).

## 7. Controls, constants and drift prevention

SR-E12-nn are epic-local requirement ids (convention of `SR-E22-nn`, `E16-FR-nn`), to be promoted into
`04-security-program.md` numbering when E12-T05 lands. All numbers are from §3.

Drift prevention: the numbers live in `candleviewer/bars/limits.py` (module to be created by E12-T05, see §11)
with a test that asserts each value and fails when a doc and the module disagree; `E12-X03` rules reference
the module, not literals.

## 8. Cross-references and shared mechanism

- **E08** (`e08-exchange-boundary.md`): W1 (hostile frame), W6 (reconnect churn), W11 (candle `confirm` before
  closed); #1898 frame guard and print rejection and #1957 priority lanes are _existing controls_ this model
  relies on and does not duplicate.
- **E07** (`E07-storage.md`): QuestDB/Parquet integrity, archive verification and retention execution; BR-16.
- **E16** (`e16-recorder.md`): recorded tape scope and purge; E12 reads, never writes, the tape.
- **E17**: WS envelope, heartbeats, backpressure (BR-13, BR-32); **E21/E26** share the per-user subscription
  budget (the G4 gap in the E22 model). The `bars.*` figures here must be reconciled with that shared budget.
- **E09**: authentication and `marketdata:read` (BR-21).
- **E35**: rule engine; if rule conditions consume bars, bar integrity (§5) is an input assumption it must state.
- **ADR-0033 (Proposed, #1968)**: rebuild generation swap, cancellation token, executor, 250 000-bar cap and
  the cancel contract are **proposed**; BR-09 and BR-31 are only fully mitigated once the ADR is Accepted and
  E12-S12 ships it.
- **Maintenance note:** a ticket that adds a bar type or a new parameter shape re-opens the **D** rows
  (BR-27..BR-31), the SR-E12-03 floors and the §3 table before it is Ready. A change of data classification
  (§6) re-opens the whole model.

## 10. Observability signals

Anything modelled as a threat with no detection signal generates an instrumentation ticket (§11); the signals
below already exist in the ticket text or are requested.

## 11. Control-to-ticket map

Every E12-* ticket appears here; a missing row is a model defect (enforced by GOV-008,
`scripts/check_threat_model_ticket_map.py`). A ticket with no control says so explicitly. Provenance tags:
`[ticket body]` = already in the ticket text; `shipped in #N` = merged; `required by this model - not yet in
the ticket; requested on #N` = a new obligation this model adds, posted as a comment on that ticket (the plan
JSON is not edited from here). ADR-0033 items are Proposed.

| Ticket                                        | Obligation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

New obligations posted: 8 ticket comments (#345, #394, #397, #398, #399, #453, #532, #535). No new tickets are
filed by this model; each ask is a scope addition to an existing, unstarted ticket. Where a ticket's reviewer
rejects a number, the number in §3 must be amended here in the same PR that changes the ticket.

## 12. Residual risks, review and sign-off

- Accepted: BR-39 (no privileged operation; re-opens on an admin rebuild), BR-22 (public aggregate data under
  the §6 classification), BR-13 and BR-16 (referenced to E17 and E07).
- **Residual (not eliminated):**
  - BR-09 and BR-31 stay open until ADR-0033 is Accepted and E12-S12 ships it; today only the existing
    `build_version` rule and the architecture-level rebuild description apply. Inherent High, residual
    Medium once shipped.
  - BR-06/BR-07/BR-08 evidence integrity: inherent High, residual Medium. A trusted-host attacker with
    write access to QuestDB can still alter rows between checksum verification points; the checksum detects
    but does not prevent. Accepted at the project's single-host threat model (`04-security-program.md` §3),
    tracked as **RSK-058**.
  - BR-28..BR-31 availability caps are starting values; a legitimate user at the per-user caps on a hot
    symbol still costs real CPU. Tracked as **RSK-059**.
- A High residual with no mitigation and no Owner acceptance blocks the E12 epic DoD (ticket acceptance
  scenario). Currently none: every High row has a mitigating ticket; BR-09/BR-31 are the ones to watch.
- Accepted risks await Owner approval (agent-delivery adaptation). Security-engineer sign-off is a PR comment
  by the independent security reviewer; architect review via PR review. Draft until then; E12-T05, T06, T03
  and S12 must not start before both. The 2-hour workshop of the ticket's technical notes is replaced by this
  agent-written model plus the two independent reviews.
