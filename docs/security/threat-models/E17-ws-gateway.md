# E17 — STRIDE threat model: Client WS protocol and gateway

- Ticket: E17-X01 (issue #381). Owner: Security engineer (CODEOWNER). Status: **Draft** for Architect +
  Security-engineer review. Accepted residual risks (§10) await Owner sign-off.
- Method: `docs/plan/04-security-program.md` §5 template (L x I = risk), STRIDE per element and per flow
  (C-12.1). Format mirrors `E13-indicators.md`. Reuses the E09 auth/RBAC model (`e09-auth-rbac.md`, U-rows);
  those threats are **referenced, not duplicated**. Upstream Bybit connection security is E08's model.
- Inputs: `docs/plan/23-ws-protocol.md` (§2-§11, §16.2), ADR-0005, and the merged gateway code under
  `services/api/candleviewer/ws/` (E17-S01 lifecycle/gateway, E17-S02 topics/permissions/revocation/upstream,
  E17-T02 binary codec) at the commit this PR is based on.
- **Data classification (per flow).** Public market-data topics: **internal**. Private topics (`orders`,
  `positions`, `executions`, `wallet`, `trade_groups`, `rules`, `alerts`, `recorder`): **confidential**,
  account- or owner-scoped. `auth_ok` / `permission_change` payload: **confidential** (enumerates the account
  scope). Access tokens: **secret**.
- **Headline concerns** (`30-release-roadmap.md` §5.4): (1) WS authentication, including the bounded
  unauthenticated window (§4); (2) topic authorisation evaluated continuously, not once (§5); (3) resource
  exhaustion of a deliberately stateful server (§6).
- Gate note: enumerates weaknesses at design level only; no credentials, hosts or exploit detail appear.

## 1. Scope

In scope: the `/ws/v1` endpoint and module M23 — subprotocol negotiation, `hello`/`welcome`, `auth`/`auth_ok`
and in-place re-auth, heartbeats and close codes (E17-S01); the topic registry, parser, per-topic permission
matrix, limits and live revocation (E17-S02); snapshot+delta sequencing and resync (E17-S03, not built yet);
coalescing and the outbound budget (E17-T03, not built yet); the CVWB binary codec on both ends (E17-T02); the
web client and its decode worker (E17-T04, not built yet); error registry (E17-T05) and observability (E17-T06).

Out of scope: implementing controls (owned by the tickets in §9); executing adversarial tests (E17-X02);
the auth/session/RBAC systems themselves (E09); upstream Bybit connection security (E08); private-topic
payload semantics (E29/E34); replay clock and session lifecycle (E26).

### 1.1 State of the build at review time

The model is written against a partially built epic. Rows marked **(planned)** describe a control that is
specified in `23-ws-protocol.md` but not merged yet; their rating assumes the named ticket ships it. Known
open gaps, already tracked:

Text description: a client opens a socket offering a subprotocol (F1) and must send `hello` then `auth` with
an access token in the first frames (F2); the token is resolved by E09 to a session and a principal snapshot
(F3-F4). Only after `auth_ok` do `sub`/`unsub`/`ctl` reach the SubscriptionManager (F5), which asks E09's
`decide` per topic family and per account (F6). Grant, role, kill-switch, session-revocation and user-disable
events (F7) re-evaluate every live subscription and push `permission_change`/`revoked`/`bye` (F8). Market
events from the bus (F9) are multiplexed per topic (F10), sequenced (F11), coalesced and bounded (F12) and
encoded once per emission (F13). In the browser, binary bodies cross to a worker as transferables (F14) and
come back decoded (F15). Denials, revocations and repeated auth failures are audited (F16-F17).

Elements: external entities **E1-E3**; processes **P1-P7, P9** (P8 reserved for the E26 replay router, out of
scope); store **DS1**; flows **F1-F17**. Every element appears in the coverage matrix (§3.7).

Boundaries:

- **TB-4 client socket -> Handshake** (F1, F2): untrusted until `auth_ok`; semi-trusted (authenticated,
  RBAC-scoped) after it. The client enforces nothing.
- **Handshake -> E09** (F3, F4, F6, F7): the gateway consumes E09's `decide` and session service; it holds no
  copy of the rules.
- **Upstream ingestion boundary** (F9): bus content is trusted for integrity (E08/E12 models) but treated as
  unbounded in rate.
- **Encoder -> socket** (F12, F13): the server's own frames become untrusted input for the client decoder.
- **Browser main <-> worker** (F14, F15): same origin, but the worker parses untrusted bytes; a decoder fault
  must stay in the worker.

## 4. WS authentication and the 10-second unauthenticated window

The window cannot be removed. Browser WebSockets cannot set an `Authorization` header, and a query-string
token is worse: it lands in proxy logs and browser history. The gateway therefore accepts the socket, then
requires `hello` as the first frame and `auth` with a bearer token within 10 s (`23-ws-protocol.md` §4.2-§4.3).
The argument is that the window is **bounded and cheap**:

- **Bounded in time.** `AUTH_TIMEOUT_S = 10` is evaluated by the per-connection watchdog against an injected
  clock; expiry sends `bye auth_timeout` and closes `4401`.
- **Bounded in attempts.** Three failed `auth` frames close `4401` with a `warning` audit entry. Three
  non-`auth` frames before `auth_ok` close the socket. Anything other than `hello` first closes `1002`.
- **Bounded in rate and size, before auth as well as after.** The 30/s and 300/min inbound limiter runs on
  every frame except `pong`, independent of auth state; the 256 KiB cap is checked on raw bytes before any
  decoding.
- **Small, fixed allocation.** Before `auth_ok` a socket holds the connection object, one writer task, a
  bounded outbound queue and a rate-limiter deque capped at 301 timestamps. No subscription state, upstream
  reference, bar lease or registry entry is created until `auth_ok`. This is not literally "nothing beyond the
  socket", but it is constant-size per connection and independent of attacker input.
- **Not unique to an identity.** The 8-connections-per-user cap applies only after auth, because before auth
  there is no user. That is why a global pre-auth cap is needed.

**Gaps (tracked, #2155):** there is no global cap on concurrent pre-auth sockets, and the `authenticate` and
principal-resolution awaits are not wrapped in `asyncio.timeout`. Until both land, the number of pre-auth
sockets is limited only by arrival rate x 10 s.

**Residual risk.** An unauthenticated party who can reach the port can occupy connection slots and a small
amount of memory per slot for 10 s at a time. Exposure is Tailscale-only with loopback/WSL-internal binds
(SR-045, SR-047), so "who can reach the port" means **a device already on the tailnet**. This is stated, not
assumed: if the exposure model changes (N3 in `04-security-program.md` §5.10), WS-S03 and WS-D07 rise to
High and the pre-auth cap becomes a release blocker. Rated **Medium** until #2155 merges, then Low.

Related: token replay, token theft, and re-auth identity switching are WS-S01, WS-S02, WS-S04; the session
model itself is E09's (U13).

## 5. Topic authorisation is continuous, not once

A check at `sub` time is necessary but not sufficient, because a subscription can outlive the grant that
justified it. The merged design (E17-S02) has three parts:

1. **At subscribe.** The family's permission is checked with E09's `decide`; for account-scoped families each
   requested account is checked individually and the set is narrowed silently. An empty result returns one
   generic `account_scope_denied` (no existence oracle). Private families refuse `replay_session_id`.
2. **On change.** Role, permission, account-grant and kill-switch changes call the registry, which resolves a
   fresh principal snapshot and re-evaluates **every** live subscription of the user. Subscriptions that lost
   their permission or all accounts are removed; partial losses are narrowed in place. Removal happens
   **synchronously before any send**, so no further frame can be routed for a withdrawn account even if the
   client is not reading. `revoked` frames follow, each send under a 2 s timeout, and stalled sockets are
   closed. Session revocation closes every socket of the session; a disabled user gets `bye` + `4403`.
3. **On re-auth.** In-place re-auth resolves a new snapshot, must keep the same user, and re-evaluates.

**Gap analysis.** Once a subscription is narrowed or dropped, emission reads the subscription's own account
set, so a withdrawn account cannot be emitted after the synchronous step. The remaining windows are about
**which snapshot is applied**, not about emission:

- _Snapshot ordering._ Principal resolution is asynchronous, so the design must guarantee that the
  snapshot applied to a connection is never older than the latest grant change, including for a connection
  that is mid-handshake when the change happens. Requirement **SR-E17-07**: snapshots carry a monotonic
  version, an older snapshot never replaces a newer one, and a connection re-checks the version after it
  registers. Owner: E17-S02 follow-up (§9). Test: E17-Q02 reconnect race and AC-14.
- _Reconnect race_ (E17-Q02). A client that reconnects during a revocation gets a fresh `auth` against the
  current grants. With SR-E17-07 it cannot inherit a stale snapshot.
- _Producer-side filtering._ Private-topic producers (E29/E34) must route events by account through the
  subscription's account set, not by user. Recorded as a referenced control (WS-I02).

Detection: `ws_revoked_total{reason}`, the `ws.subscription.revoked` and `ws.subscribe.denied` audit actions,
and a metric for denied cross-account subscribes per identity (§8).

## 6. Resource exhaustion — where a security limit and a performance budget are the same number

The gateway deliberately holds per-connection state and queues. Every bound below is a DoS control **and** a
performance limit. **Neither may be relaxed for the other's reasons**: for example, loosening the 8 MiB
outbound budget to help a slow link silently removes WS-D01's control. A change to any number here needs a
security review in the same PR.

heatmaps. Encode-once-send-many keeps CPU flat in client count, but per-user cost is real and unmeasured until
E17-Q03. Tracked as **RSK-063**.

## 7. Abuse-case seeds (handed to E17-X02)

Each seed is executable as written against a test stack. "M1" is a Manager granted account A only; "V" is a
read-only role; "O" is the Owner. Expected = frame/close code plus the named metric or audit action.

## 9. Control-to-ticket map

Every E17-* ticket appears here; a missing row is a model defect (GOV-008,
`scripts/check_threat_model_ticket_map.py`). Requirement ids: `SR-074`, `SR-073`, `SR-040`, `SR-128`,
`SR-155`, `SR-122`, `SR-151` (existing) and `SR-183..SR-189` (added to `04-security-program.md` §6.18 by this
PR; local aliases `SR-E17-01..07` in the rows above map 1:1 to SR-183..SR-189).

**Gaps that become work.** Every control gap is already a ticket or owned by a named open E17 ticket: #2155
(pre-auth cap, await timeouts, web hello/auth) and the new follow-up for SR-189 (snapshot versioning) on
E17-S02. SR-183..SR-188 are requested as scope on the open tickets named above.

## 10. Residual risks, review and sign-off

- **Accepted (awaiting Owner sign-off):** WS-I04 (build and connection identifiers visible pre-auth on a
  tailnet-only service); WS-R04 (best-effort audit on the WS path: the denial still happens).
- **Residual Medium (not eliminated):**
  - WS-S03 / WS-D07: pre-auth slot exhaustion by a tailnet device until #2155 adds a global cap and auth-await
    timeouts. Low once merged. Tracked as **RSK-063**'s first trigger.
  - WS-D08: per-user amplification on hot symbols is bounded but unmeasured until E17-Q03. **RSK-063**.
- **Contingent Low:** WS-D01, WS-D03, WS-T07, WS-D10 and WS-I05 are rated on planned controls (E17-T03, E17-S03,
  E17-T04); re-triaged at each PR's security review if the control is missing. WS-E02 is Low contingent on
  SR-189. **RSK-064** records the continuous-authorisation risk until then.
- No High residual. The pre-auth argument (§4) holds only for tailnet-only exposure.
- Status is **Draft**: the Owner accepts the residual risks above (agent-delivery adaptation); the
  Security-engineer sign-off is a PR comment by the independent security reviewer; Architect review via PR
  review.
