# E22 — STRIDE threat model: Big trades and bubbles (tape, BigTradeEngine, clustering)

- Ticket: E22-X01 (issue #609). Owner: Security engineer (CODEOWNER). Status: Draft for Security + Architect review.
- Method: `docs/plan/04-security-program.md` §5 template (L x I = risk), STRIDE per epic (C-12.1). Reuses the
  exchange-boundary trust model of E08 (`e08-exchange-boundary.md`, W1-W11) and the adversarial register
  `services/api/tests/security/ingestion/E08_X02_FINDINGS.md`; those threats are **referenced, not duplicated**.
  Format mirrors `E24-derivatives.md` and `E25-detectors.md`.
- **Data classification: public market data plus internal user settings (per-symbol thresholds).** No secrets,
  no PII, no account or key material. Confirmed in §6 and D9-D13, not assumed.
- **Headline:** the real exposure of this epic is **availability**. A public-data surface that can be made
  expensive by one authenticated client degrades every other view, including the R3 trading surfaces.
  The STRIDE rows for S/T/R/I/E are short on purpose; §3 and the D-rows carry the weight.
- Gate note: this file enumerates weaknesses only; no credentials or hosts appear.

## 1. Scope

In scope: Bybit `publicTrade` (E08) -> normaliser -> bus -> M9 `BigTradeEngine` (E22-T01: thresholds,
percentiles, deterministic clustering) -> REST `GET /market/trades` and `/market/metrics` and WS
`trades.{symbol}` (E22-T02) -> shared worker -> SCR-053 tape (CMP-195 and friends) and the bubble series
(CMP-112, E22-S03) -> client ring buffer (E22-S05); plus the `settings` write path for per-symbol thresholds
(E22-S02) and whale alerts (E22-S06, flood control only; rule-side threats belong to E35/E25).
Out of scope: executing the abuse cases (E22-X02), implementing mitigations (owner tickets),
pen-testing, E21/E26 models (§8 cross-references the shared subscription-budget).

Boundaries: **TB1->TB2** (F1: all upstream content untrusted; handled by E08 and its #1898 plausibility
layer); **TB2->TB3** (F7, F8: authenticated and RBAC-scoped; **the client is trusted to enforce nothing**,
including thresholds); **TB3->TB2** (F10: client-supplied subscription options and settings values are
hostile input). F2-F6 and F11 are in-process or loopback.

## 3. Numeric bounds: contract today, and recommended values

Every bound below must be enforced by validation **before** any query, allocation or subscription is
created; truncation after the fact is not a control (budget #13, API read p95 < 150 ms).

Cluster window and tolerance are **estimated** inputs (`trade_cluster`, window default 50 ms); the exact
tape is never altered by them. This is a trust control: the CMP-227 EstimatedBadge must be present whenever
clustering is on (SR-E22-12).

## 6. Information disclosure and elevation of privilege

Information: every field in `trades.{symbol}` and `PublicTrade` is public exchange data
(`id`, `ts_ms`, `price`, `size`, `side`, flags). The schemas are `additionalProperties:false` and contain no
user, account or key field. The residual question is cross-user inference (D10, D11): a shared engine
instance serving several subscribers is an optimisation that must not become an oracle. The requirement
(SR-E22-15) is that **no response, ack, error or metric depends on another user's options**.

Privilege: the only state-changing operation is the per-user threshold write (D25). RBAC (`marketdata:read`,
`settings:write` own-scope) is enforced server-side (C-12.4); hiding a control in the UI is not a control.
`services/api/secrets/`, `auth/`, `audit/` are untouched except for emitting `settings.change`.

## 7. Controls, constants and drift prevention

**Single source of constants.** The bounds in §3 live in one module, proposed
`services/api/candleviewer/orderflow/limits.py` (E22-T01), imported by the engine, the REST validator and
the WS option validator. Nothing else may hold a literal copy. Constants (all `Final`):

| Constant                                                    | Value                                              | SR        |

| `MIN_SIZE_FLOOR`                                            | per instrument: max(`lot_size`, one tick-notional) | SR-E22-03 |
| `CLUSTER_WINDOW_MS_MAX`                                     | 5000 REST, 2000 WS                                 | SR-E22-04 |
| `CLUSTER_TOLERANCE_TICKS_MAX`                               | 20                                                 | SR-E22-04 |
| `CLUSTER_KEYS_MAX` / `PRINTS_BUFFER_MAX`                    | 4096 / 16384 per symbol                            | SR-E22-05 |
| `TRADES_SUBS_PER_USER_MAX` / `CONNECTIONS_PER_USER_MAX`     | 60 / 5                                             | SR-E22-06 |
| `OPTION_SETS_PER_SYMBOL_MAX`                                | 2                                                  | SR-E22-07 |
| `CLIENT_QUEUE_MAX_FRAMES`                                   | 256                                                | SR-E22-08 |
| `RING_BUFFER_MAX_PRINTS` / `_BYTES` / `VISIBLE_BUBBLES_MAX` | 50 000 / 32 MiB / 5 000                            | SR-E22-09 |
| `BUBBLE_FLASH_MAX_HZ`                                       | 3                                                  | SR-E22-10 |
| `THRESHOLD_SYMBOLS_PER_USER_MAX`                            | 200                                                | SR-E22-11 |

Requirement ids not tied to a constant: SR-E22-12 (estimated badge whenever clustering is on), SR-E22-13
(engine input assert: `Decimal` > 0 and on tick), SR-E22-14 (trimmed percentile estimator), SR-E22-15 (no
response, ack, error or metric depends on another user's options).

**Tests that must assert the constants** (so bounds cannot drift silently):

1. A unit test in E22-T01 imports `limits.py` and asserts every value above verbatim; changing a value
   requires editing the test and therefore a reviewed diff (CODEOWNER on `orderflow/limits.py`).
2. A contract test in E22-T02 asserts the OpenAPI `maximum`/`minimum` of `cluster_window_ms`,
   `cluster_tolerance_ticks`, `limit` and the WS schema equal the constants, and that the window cap and
   `min_size` floor are documented (closes G1, G2 by interface-first PR).
3. A boundary-table test (value, value+1, 0, negative, non-finite) per constant in E22-Q01.
4. A client-side test in E22-S05 asserts the ring-buffer ceiling and visible-bubble cap read from the same
   generated constants as the server (`packages/protocol`), not literals.

**SAST (Semgrep) named, not authored here (follow-up for E22-X02 / infra owners):**

- Forbid big-trade threshold or cluster literals in `apps/web/src` (server is the sole source of truth; D5).
- Forbid `asyncio.Queue()` without `maxsize` and unbounded appends of prints in `orderflow/` (C-2.18).
- Forbid building a clustered print without the `estimated` flag (D6).
- Contract lint: every E22 operation declares `x-rbac`; the settings route declares `settings:write`.

## 8. Cross-references and shared mechanism

- **Subscription budget.** E21 (STRIDE: unbounded subscription depth) and E26 face the same vector. The
  mitigation must be **one** gateway-level per-user budget (subscriptions, connections, option sets) in
  the E17 gateway, parameterised per topic family, not a separate cap per epic. E22-T02 consumes it; if it
  does not exist yet, E22-T02 lands the interface (budget protocol plus a fake) first, per interface-first
  (CLAUDE.md §10.4). Tracked as gap **G4**.
- **Upstream integrity.** D3 and D20 rely on E08 and #1898; this model adds no duplicate parser checks.
- **Flash ceiling.** `05-accessibility-standard.md` §7.3 (3 flashes/s) and E47-S04 own the shared gate;
  E22 wires the bubble component into it (D21).
- **Shared fate with trading.** Load-shedding degrades market-data views only; it must never consume the
  order-path reserve (C-12.7). `trades.*` gateway queues are separate from order/ack queues.

SR-E22-nn are epic-local requirement ids (convention of `E16-FR-nn` / `E35-FR-nn`), to be promoted into
`04-security-program.md` numbering when E22-T02 lands. Interface-first gaps: **G1** window cap, **G2**
`min_size` floor (22-api), **G3** state caps (24-internal-schemas), **G4** per-user budget (23-ws `limits`),
**G5** option-set cap, **G6** frame-level `estimated` flag (23-ws §14.2).

## 12. Residual risks, review and sign-off

- Accepted: D8 (read abuse attributable only via request logs), D11 (no cross-user side channel), D27 (no
  privileged path beyond own-scope settings write).
- Residual: a legitimate user at the per-user cap on hot symbols still costs real CPU; bounded, not
  eliminated (RSK-057). Percentile thresholds on thin symbols are statistically noisy (labelled, not removable).
- Accepted risks await Owner approval (agent-delivery adaptation). Security-engineer sign-off is a PR
  comment by the independent security reviewer; architect review via PR review. Draft until then;
  E22-T01/T02 must not start before both.
