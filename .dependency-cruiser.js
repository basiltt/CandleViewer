// GENERATED-STYLE hand-written config (not machine-generated, but treat edits
// with the same care): dependency-cruiser contracts for the frontend module
// boundaries in `CONSTITUTION.md` §3 ("Frontend module boundaries" table),
// C-2.16 (chart-engine independence) and C-3.5 (`apps/web` never imports
// another app; `packages/*` never import `apps/*`).
//
// E02-T06 (§9 #18: "architecture — import-linter module-boundary contracts
// (§3) + dependency-cruiser for TS + deep-import ban"). Every `comment`
// field below cites the exact rule id so a CI failure is self-explanatory
// (Constitution preamble: "reviewers cite rule ids in PRs").
//
// The descriptive mirror of these rules lives in
// `docs/plan/module-contracts.toml` under `[[frontend_package]]`; keep the
// two in sync by hand when either changes (there is no TS-side manifest
// parser — the drift test's frontend half only checks the rule count, see
// `services/api/tests/unit/architecture/test_module_contracts_drift.py`).
