# Contributing to CandleViewer

CandleViewer is a private, self-hosted trading terminal (React + custom WebGL chart engine + Electron
shell, Python FastAPI monolith, Bybit v5 USDT linear perpetuals). It places real orders with real capital,
so the bar for changes is high and the rules are explicit.

If anything below appears to conflict with the Constitution, **the Constitution wins** and the conflict is
a bug to report.

## The short version

1. **Start from a Ready issue.** Check it against the Definition of Ready (Constitution §11.1). If
   acceptance criteria, design sign-off, dependencies or estimate are missing, comment on the issue and
   stop — do not guess.
2. **One ticket = one branch = one PR.** Branch as `<type>/<epic-key>-<short-slug>` using `feat/`, `fix/`,
   `chore/`, `design/`, `spike/` or `docs/` (Constitution §4.2).
3. **Contract first.** If the REST/WS surface changes, edit `docs/plan/22-api-openapi.yaml` or
   `docs/plan/23-ws-protocol.md` and regenerate `packages/protocol` before writing implementation code
   (§6).
4. **Tests first, at the right level.** Unit for pure logic, integration for boundaries (with recorded
   Bybit fixtures — no live-exchange calls in CI), E2E only for user-visible critical paths (§13).
   Exchange payloads come from the shared corpus `packages/fixtures/bybit/` (via
   `services/api/tests/_corpus.py`). The only suite that reaches Bybit is the opt-in, demo-only,
   credential-free `exchange_smoke` suite. Its fail-closed environment guard is explained in
   `services/api/tests/exchange_smoke/README.md`.
5. **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** with an allowed scope; `commitlint`
   enforces it (§4.4). This also feeds the changelog: your PR title must be a conventional-commit header,
   or the PR body must include a `Changelog: <one-line user-facing summary>` footer — the
   `changelog-fragment` check (`tools/ci/check_changelog_fragment.py`, CI-REL-001) fails otherwise, except
   for PRs whose title is `chore:`/`ci:`/`docs:` (docs/plan/07-release-and-prr.md §3). A merge to `main`
   with a usable fragment lands a bullet in `CHANGELOG.md`'s `Unreleased` section automatically.
6. **Rebase, never merge** (`git pull --rebase origin main`). PRs land on `main` as a squash. `main` is
   protected: no direct pushes, no force-pushes (§4.5).
7. **Keep it small.** ≤400 changed LOC preferred; >800 needs a `large-pr-approved` label with a written
   justification (C-4.8).
8. **Open a PR with `Closes #N`** and the template fully completed, with evidence attached (test output,
   screenshots for UI, benchmark deltas for engine work, migration up/down output for schema work).
9. **Get 2 approvals including 1 CODEOWNER.** Security-sensitive paths need `@CandleViewer/security`; UI
   changes need `design-approved` and a Done design ticket (§10).
10. **Merging means In Test, not Done.** Only QA or the owner moves a ticket to Done (§10, §11.2).

## Quality gates

Every PR must pass **all** required CI checks. **The single source of truth for the list of check names,
and for what each one enforces, is [`CONSTITUTION.md` §9 (Quality gates)](CONSTITUTION.md#9-quality-gates-required-ci-checks).**
It is deliberately **not** duplicated here, in `AGENTS.md`, or in the PR template — a renamed check must
require exactly one edit, in one file. If you find a check list copied into any other document, delete it
and link to §9 instead.

Rules that always hold, wherever the list lives:

- A red required check is never merged. There is no admin merge and no "re-run until green".
- Checks are never disabled, skipped, marked `continue-on-error`, or removed from branch protection in a
  feature PR. Changing the required-check set is an amendment (Constitution §16).
- Coverage floors are floors and may never be lowered in the PR that fails them (C-9.4). Per-package floors,
  ratchet baselines and tolerance live in `tools/ci/coverage-baselines.json` (CODEOWNER-gated by the QA
  lead — see `.github/CODEOWNERS`); the `coverage-thresholds` check (`tools/ci/coverage_gate.py`) reads it
  and fails a PR with a specific `CI-COV-00x` code and reason rather than a bare red X.
- Run the same gates locally before pushing — see [`AGENTS.md` §4 (Commands)](AGENTS.md#4-commands), which
  is the single source of truth for task/script names.

## Hard boundaries

Out of scope, and rejected on sight (Constitution §1.3): Android/iOS or any mobile client; a separate admin
application (admin lives as RBAC-gated screens inside the web app); any exchange other than Bybit or any
category other than USDT linear perpetuals; options/GEX; withdrawal, transfer or funding code; public
internet exposure (Tailscale only); multi-tenant/SaaS productisation; a third-party chart library as the
production renderer.

Safety invariants that no flag, environment or "advanced mode" may weaken: every position-opening order
carries a **native exchange-side stop-loss**; API keys **never leave** the secrets module; **withdrawal
permission is never enabled**; **every order action is audited** append-only; **RBAC and risk caps are
enforced server-side**.

## Local commands

**Single source of truth: [`AGENTS.md` §4 (Commands)](AGENTS.md#4-commands).** Task names are not
duplicated here. The monorepo scaffold (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `package.json`,
`services/api/pyproject.toml`) shipped with `E02-T11`, so `AGENTS.md` §4 mirrors the real, runnable
task graph. The generated-code required check fails the build if `AGENTS.md` §4 and the real scripts
disagree.

**Reproducing any CI gate locally, and what a red check means:** see
[`docs/ci-runbook.md`](docs/ci-runbook.md) §4 for the full per-error-code
(`CI-<FAMILY>-<NNN>`) triage table — this file does not duplicate it. The
runbook also covers the dev-environment rebuild procedure (§7), secret-exposure
response (§5), bad-deploy rollback (§8) and the flaky-test quarantine process
(§9); this section stays limited to the JS/generated-code local-reproduction
commands already documented below.

See `AGENTS.md` §4 for the root install/verify command and the backend lint/format/typecheck/test loop.

After `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, run `pnpm prepare` once to install the local git hooks
(`.husky/`: `commit-msg` commitlint, `pre-commit` lint-staged, `pre-push` branch-name + affected-project
typecheck). This is a deliberate, code-owned exception to the repo's `ignore-scripts=true` posture — see
the comment in `.npmrc` — so it is not run implicitly by `pnpm install`. Hooks are a convenience; the same
rules are enforced server-side by CI and cannot be weakened by `--no-verify`.

### Generated-code freshness (`packages/protocol`)

`packages/protocol` is regenerated from `docs/plan/22-api-openapi.yaml` and the WS schema in
`docs/plan/23-ws-protocol.md` (ADR-0013 binding rule 3, ADR-0005). If you touch either source, run
`make gen` and commit the resulting diff under `packages/protocol` — never hand-edit
`packages/protocol/src/generated/**`.

The `gen` job (`.github/workflows/_job-gen.yml`) is an always-on required check. If it fails:

1. **`CI-GEN-003` (codegen is not deterministic)** — the generator itself is flaky; this is a bug in
   `packages/protocol/scripts/*`, not something you can fix by regenerating again. Reproduce locally
   with `make gen && make gen` and diff the tree; file it against the protocol package before retrying.
2. **`CI-GEN-001` (drift)** — run `make gen` locally, review the diff under `packages/protocol`, and
   commit it in the same PR as the schema change.
3. **`CI-GEN-002` (untracked output)** — `make gen` produced a new file CI can see via `git status` but
   `git diff` couldn't. Check `.gitignore` hasn't accidentally swallowed a new generated path, then `git
add` and commit it.
4. **`CI-GEN-004` (generator toolchain failure)** — the generator command itself errored (missing
   dependency, syntax error in the schema, pinned tool version mismatch); the job summary and step log
   carry the underlying stdout/stderr.

Run the same check locally before pushing: `make gen-check` (wraps
`tools/ci/check_gen_freshness.py`).

**Reproducing the JS CI lane locally** (E03-T02, `.github/workflows/_job-js.yml`): the lane is exactly
`pnpm turbo run <task> --filter='...[origin/main]'` for `lint`, `typecheck`, `test:cov` (split into
`unit-frontend`: `ui`/`web`/`desktop`, and `unit-engine`: `chart-engine`/`protocol`), then `build` — same
task names as `pnpm verify`, just scoped to what changed since `origin/main` the way CI scopes it. Run
the whole thing exactly as CI does with:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
node tools/ci/run-allowed-postinstall.mjs   # SR-138 exception list (electron, esbuild)
pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test:cov build --filter='...[origin/main]'
```

CI reads `TURBO_API`/`TURBO_TEAM` (repository variables) and, on `main`-branch runs only, a write-scoped
`TURBO_TOKEN` secret for the Turborepo remote cache (ADR-0013 rule 6); PR runs and local runs without
those variables set simply fall back to Turborepo's local cache.

### Governance regression pack (`GOV-00n` codes)

The `governance` required check (`.github/workflows/governance.yml`, E01-Q02) runs a fixed pack of
checkers, each emitting a stable `GOV-00n` code so CI history stays greppable. Reproduce any of them
locally with `python scripts/<checker>.py` (or `python docs/plan/backlog/_tools/validate.py` for the
backlog report tool); fix instructions live in the tool's own `--help` and its emitted message.

The job also runs a **canary self-test** (`python scripts/gov_self_test.py --self-test`) that replays
every checker above against a deliberately-broken fixture tree under
`scripts/tests/fixtures/self_test/` and asserts each one fails — the guard against a green `governance`
check that has silently stopped checking anything — and a **coverage gate** (`pytest --cov=scripts
--cov-fail-under=85`) over all of `scripts/**`. Job duration is measured against a 60s budget and
recorded as a `::notice` annotation on every run; exceeding the budget fails the job (`::error`
annotation). Per-run artefacts (CODEOWNERS ownership report, backlog per-epic summary) are uploaded
as the `governance-reports` artefact for diffable history across runs.

Sprints are **1 week** (Fri→Thu; Sprint 01 = 2026-09-25; calendar in `docs/plan/backlog/_tools/calendar_cv.py`). Design runs at least two sprints ahead of engineering; no frontend screen work starts before its design
ticket is Done. Architectural decisions are recorded as MADR ADRs in `docs/adr/` and must be proposed
before implementation (Constitution §15.1).

## Governance map — which document owns what

Every list in this repo has exactly one owner (`CONSTITUTION.md` C-16.5); everything else links to it
instead of restating it. See the [C-16.5 single-source-of-truth registry](CONSTITUTION.md#16-amendment-process)
for the authoritative table (rules, CI check names, budgets, commands, repo layout, ownership, security
policy, ticket schema, statechart contracts). If you find the same list copied into a second file, that
copy is a bug — delete it and link to the owner instead.

## Branch protection break-glass runbook

`main` protection (`.github/branch-protection.json`, applied by
`scripts/apply_branch_protection.py`, `enforce_admins: true`) has no built-in
bypass — that is the point (C-9.1). If protection must be lifted in a genuine
emergency (e.g. to land a hotfix while CI infrastructure itself is down):

1. Only `@basiltt` or a person they explicitly delegate in writing on the
   tracking issue may perform the bypass.
2. Before changing anything, open (or comment on) the dedicated break-glass
   tracking issue, stating: what is broken, why waiting for a normal PR is not
   possible, and the exact setting(s) about to change.
3. Use the repository-administration-scoped credential only via the GitHub UI
   or `gh api`, never the automated apply script (which never runs from a
   PR-triggered workflow, by design).
4. Restore `.github/branch-protection.json` settings immediately after the
   emergency merge — do not leave protection weakened.
5. The weekly `governance-drift` workflow (GOV-005, `.github/workflows/governance-drift.yml`)
   will detect any settings left un-restored and open a `priority/p1-high`
   `security`-labelled issue regardless of step 4 — this is deliberate, not a
   bug: break-glass usage is always independently recorded.
6. The tracking issue is reviewed at the R4 live-enablement gate
   (`docs/plan/28-statechart-catalogue.md` B-series live gate; see
   `docs/plan/30-release-roadmap.md`).

Break-glass is for repository infrastructure emergencies only — it is never a
substitute for getting a second review on a normal change.

## Reporting security issues

Never open a public issue for a vulnerability. Follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Changing the rules

The Constitution changes only through its [amendment process](CONSTITUTION.md#16-amendment-process):
a `constitution`-labelled issue, an amendment PR updating every affected artefact, a 3-working-day
discussion period, and approval from the architect, the security engineer, affected CODEOWNERS and
`@basiltt`. Local exceptions, temporary bypasses and undocumented practices are not permitted.
