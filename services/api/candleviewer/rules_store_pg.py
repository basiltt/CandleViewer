"""Postgres `RuleStore` adapter for `RulesManager` (E35-S01; tables from `0013_rules`).

Composition-root helper (like `health_wiring`): `rules` (M15) may not import `storage` (M10)
and vice versa, so only this wiring module sees both. Static, parameterised SQL.

Mapping: one `rules` row per `RuleRow`; one immutable `rule_versions` row per `VersionRow`
(`UNIQUE (rule_id, version)` is the database-level optimistic-concurrency backstop and
`UNIQUE (rule_id, ir_hash)` the dedupe guarantee). Simulation evidence has no column of
its own: it is stored per version in `rule_versions.backtest_summary`
(`{"simulated": true, "fires": n, "hours": h}`), so "simulated on this exact ir_hash" is
provable from the version row. `rules.armed_at/armed_by` satisfy `rule_armed_shape`.
