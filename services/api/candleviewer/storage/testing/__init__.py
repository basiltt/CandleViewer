"""In-memory fakes for every M10 repository Protocol.

Shipped as part of the package's public test surface (ticket "Scope /
Deliverables": "shipped as part of the package's public test surface so
other modules import them") — any other module's tests may
`from candleviewer.storage.testing import FakeMarketDataRepository` without
reaching into `services/api/tests/`.

Every fake is a plain class satisfying its Protocol structurally
(`isinstance(fake, MarketDataRepository)` is `True` at runtime because the
Protocols are `@runtime_checkable`) — no inheritance required.
