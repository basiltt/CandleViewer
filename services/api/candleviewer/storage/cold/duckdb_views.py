"""DuckDB view layer over the Parquet lake — `21-database-schema.md` Sec.5.5.

Views hold no state and are rebuilt from source on every start. DuckDB runs
in-process only (SR-048: no server mode, no port). The optional Postgres
attachment is `READ_ONLY` as the `cv_ro` role, so analytics can never mutate
the ledger. No `INSTALL` is issued for the Parquet path (the reader is built
in), so building the lake views needs no network; the `postgres` extension
is only installed/loaded when a DSN is supplied (deployment-time).
