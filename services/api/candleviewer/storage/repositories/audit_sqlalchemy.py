"""`SqlAlchemyAuditRepository` — the concrete Postgres implementation of
`candleviewer.audit.repository.AuditRepository` (E09-T02).

Lives in M10 (`storage`, allowed to import `sqlalchemy`) so `candleviewer.audit`
never imports a storage driver directly (CONSTITUTION.md ADR-0003, C-3.1).
Structurally compatible with the `AuditRepository` Protocol without importing
`candleviewer.audit` — the composition root injects it into `AuditService(repository=...)`;
neither module imports the other.
