"""Postgres `DispatchStore` for the alert dispatcher (E40-T04).

Lease: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` over `ix_outbox_ready`, honouring an unexpired
`locked_until` held by another worker. Every settle is one transaction that updates the
delivery conditionally (`WHERE status = 'queued'`) and the outbox row together, so a crash
between adapter call and settle re-delivers at most the adapter call, never the record
(the outbox row is unique on `(topic, dedup_key)` — `ux_outbox_dedup`).
