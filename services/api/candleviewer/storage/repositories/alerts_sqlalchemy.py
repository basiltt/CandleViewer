"""Postgres repository for alerts (migration `0014_alerts`, E40-T01).

Lives in M10 (`storage`): only M10 may import a storage driver (ADR-0003) and M10
may not import `candleviewer.alerts` (M22), so this module returns plain frozen
dataclasses. `webhook_url_enc` / `webhook_secret_enc` are SECRET: the read path
selects an explicit column allow-list (`ALERT_COLUMNS`) that never contains them.
Cursor pagination is keyset (opaque base64 of `(ts, id)`), never OFFSET.
Static, parameterised SQL only. Deliveries: `alert_deliveries_sqlalchemy.py`.
