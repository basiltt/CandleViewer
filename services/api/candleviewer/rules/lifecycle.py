"""`RuleLifecycle`: the B9 `rule_instance` chart *is* the rule mode lifecycle (E35-S01).

There is no hand-written mode enum or transition table here (ticket scope, C-2.19): every
mode change is an event sent through `statechart.gateway` to an interpreter built only by
`statechart.factory.build("rule_instance")`, and legality is whatever the committed chart
(28-statechart-catalogue.md §B9) accepts. The API's three modes are a *projection* of the
chart's states (`mode_of`), and a requested target names the B9 events that can reach it
(`_EVENTS_FOR`); the chart decides which, if any, the current state handles.

C-2.21: `RulesManager` runs the synchronous RBAC / arming checks *before* anything is
sent; the chart records. Every send is pre-checked with `can()` (guards evaluated, no side
effects) so an event the current state does not handle is refused here and never parked on
the `onUnhandled: "defer"` queue, where it could fire later (CV-C06).

Interpreters are built lazily per rule and hydrated from the persisted `rules.mode` with
`replay=True` events; they are bounded per process (C-2.18) and rebuilt from the row on
next use. Sealed-snapshot restore (`statechart.persistence.restore`) replaces hydration
once a snapshot repository is wired (E50); until then the row is the durable truth.
