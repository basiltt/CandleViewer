"""Real, host-wide listening-socket enumerator for the composition root.

`binding_check.enumerator_from_sockets` only sees the sockets `uvicorn`
itself created; it cannot see a Windows-side `portproxy` leak on WSL (the
exact hazard `20-architecture.md` "WSL hazards" names) because that traffic
never touches a Python-owned socket object. This module enumerates the
*entire host's* listening sockets via `psutil.net_connections()` (which reads
`/proc/net/tcp*` on Linux/WSL and the OS-wide socket table on Windows) plus,
on Windows/WSL, the `netsh interface portproxy` table, which is the mechanism
that creates a leak `psutil` itself cannot see (a `portproxy` rule forwards a
Windows-side listening address to a WSL IP without there being a
Windows-owned listening socket that shares the WSL process's identity).

Fail-closed:
- `OSError`/`psutil.Error` propagate to the caller so `BindingSelfCheck.run()`
  treats an unreadable socket table as unsafe, per its own docstring.
- An enumeration that comes back *empty* is itself treated as unsafe: a
  process that binds to anything at all should always show at least one
  listening socket, so an empty result means the enumeration mechanism is
  broken (wrong permissions, wrong process scope, sandboxed/isolated netns)
  rather than that the host has no listeners. Silently reporting "OK" from a
  broken enumerator is exactly the failure mode this module exists to avoid.
