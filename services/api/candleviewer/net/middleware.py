"""ASGI middleware rejecting off-mesh requests before authentication.

Applies to both HTTP and the WS upgrade (ASGI `scope["type"]` in
`{"http", "websocket"}`). The source address is taken from the ASGI
`scope["client"]` socket peer tuple only; a client-controllable header
(`X-Forwarded-For` and friends) is never consulted unless an explicitly
configured trusted proxy sits in front — and even then only that proxy's
own immediate peer address is trusted to supply it, never an arbitrary
downstream hop.

This middleware only guards the *mesh-membership* check (per-request CIDR
match on the source address); it does not consult or mutate
`ReadOnlyGate` — that flag is driven by the boot/hourly binding self-check
(see `binding_check.apply_self_check_result`) and is consulted directly by
the OMS validator, never by this middleware, so a request cannot route
around a tripped gate by simply being on-mesh.
