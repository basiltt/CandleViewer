"""Order validator enforcing the process-wide read-only gate (E09-T04 AC3).

"Read-only mode is a single process-wide flag consulted by the OMS
validator (`20-architecture.md` §3.x `Validator`) so it cannot be bypassed by
any route" (ticket Technical notes). This module never imports
`candleviewer.net` (M14's §3 allow-list does not include it): the read-only
flag is injected as a structurally-typed `ReadOnlyCheck` at construction time
by the composition root (`candleviewer.app`), which *is* allowed to import
both M14 and the `net` package. Mirrors the `SecretsHandle`/`AuditHandle`
type-alias pattern `admin.wiring` already uses to avoid a direct import edge.
