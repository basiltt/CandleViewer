"""Per-stage latency arithmetic for the tick → paint budget (E04-T06, US-OBS-002).

An exchange event carries five stage timestamps (`StageStamps`); each stage's
cost is a subtraction, not a guess. The exchange-origin stage
(`t_exchange → t_received`) is on the exchange's clock, so it is only
reported when a clock-offset measurement exists (`bybit_clock_drift_ms`,
E08/US-MKT-009); without one it is `None` ("unavailable") — never a raw,
skew-dominated or negative number.

Percentiles do not sum: per-stage histograms are for *attribution*; the
end-to-end p95 comes from `e2e_tick_to_paint_seconds`, a genuine paired
measurement on a 1-in-N sampled event (`EndToEndSampler`).
