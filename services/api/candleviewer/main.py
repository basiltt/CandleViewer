"""ASGI entrypoint (`uvicorn candleviewer.main:app`).

Wires the module supervisor into the FastAPI lifespan so `start_all()`/
`stop_all()` run around the server's lifetime (Sec.6.2). Not exercised by
unit tests (which call `create_app()` directly with fakes); covered by
E02-T08's compose smoke test.

E09-T04: the boot binding self-check (AC1/AC3) and the hourly re-check
scheduler (AC5) are started here, not in `create_app()`, so a unit test that
only calls `create_app()` (E02-T05 acceptance criterion 3: no I/O) never
enumerates real sockets — only the ASGI lifespan, which is this module's own
concern, does that.
