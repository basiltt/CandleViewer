"""`POST /auth/login` (E09-S01, US-ONB-001) and the E09-S02 (US-ONB-002/003)
MFA endpoints: `/auth/mfa/verify`, `/auth/mfa/enroll`,
`/auth/mfa/enroll/confirm`, `/auth/mfa/recovery`.

Thin HTTP adapter over `candleviewer.auth.login_service.LoginService` /
`candleviewer.auth.mfa_service.MfaService`: translates typed domain errors
to the RFC 7807-shaped problem responses the tickets' acceptance criteria
specify, and — when a live `AuditWriter` is injected — emits the
`auth.mfa_*` actions already registered in
`candleviewer.audit.actions.AUDIT_ACTIONS`. `api` (M23) is on the allow-list
to import `candleviewer.audit`; `auth` itself is not (see
`auth/login_service.py`'s module docstring) — that boundary is exactly why
the audit calls live in this router. On the fake/CI default backend
(`audit_writer=None`) the routes still work; they just skip the audit call.

**Deviation 1 (PR #1618 review finding 1 — security, blocking until
resolved as below):** `/auth/mfa/enroll`, `/auth/mfa/enroll/confirm` and
`/auth/mfa/recovery`'s regeneration sibling are `x-rbac scope: self` per
`22-api-openapi.yaml`, which normally means "the authenticated caller,
resolved from their session". Real session authentication (the
`cv_refresh` cookie / bearer access token / RBAC middleware) is E09-S03
scope, not yet merged, so there is today no way to verify that an
`X-User-Id`/`X-Username` header actually belongs to the caller — trusting
it would let anyone enrol (and read the one-time recovery codes for) any
account, an MFA takeover. Per this repo's multi-agent protocol §5 this is
not a "minor gap" (it touches security/money-adjacent identity), so rather
than guessing at an undocumented trust boundary, `/auth/mfa/enroll` and
`/auth/mfa/enroll/confirm` are **disabled** (`501 Not Implemented`) until
E09-S03 wires real session/principal resolution — mirroring exactly how
`api/audit.py`'s `principal_resolver=None` path already fails closed with
`501` for the same reason (see that module's docstring). `/auth/login`,
`/auth/mfa/verify` and `/auth/mfa/recovery`'s login path need no such
header: they resolve the user from the `mfa_token` challenge alone,
exactly like `/auth/login` needs no prior session — so those three stay
enabled.

**Deviation 2 (PR #1618 review finding 2 — acceptance criterion):** the
ticket's "Valid code creates a session" scenario is not fully met by this
PR: `/auth/mfa/verify` and the recovery-code login path in
`/auth/mfa/recovery` both return `{"status": "authenticated"}` but mint no
session (no `cv_refresh` cookie, no access token) — session/token minting
is E09-S03 scope (`auth/login_service.py`'s own docstring: "non-MFA
session issuance is E09-S03 scope"; the same boundary applies to the MFA
leg). This PR closes E09-S02 exactly as scoped ("second factor,
enrolment and recovery codes"); the end-to-end scenario is completed by
E09-S03, which is already `blocked_by` this story and picks this up next.

Source IP resolution intentionally does not trust `X-Forwarded-For` unless
the deployment topology has a trusted reverse proxy configured elsewhere
(out of this ticket's scope, C-2.11); it reads `request.client.host`, which
is correct for CandleViewer's binding model (`127.0.0.1`/Tailscale — see
`50-security.md`).
