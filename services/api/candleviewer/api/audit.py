"""`GET /admin/audit`, `POST /admin/audit/verify`, `POST /admin/audit/export`
(E09-T02 acceptance criteria: "Endpoints ... `GET /admin/audit` ... `POST
/admin/audit/verify` ... `POST /admin/audit/export`").

QA defect #1596 blocker 1: `candleviewer.audit.query.AuditQueryService` and
`candleviewer.audit.access.authorize` existed but no `APIRouter` mounted
them — `grep -rn 'APIRouter' services/api/candleviewer/audit` found
nothing. This module is the thin HTTP adapter `api/auth.py` already
establishes the pattern for: structural Protocols for the injected
services (no import edge beyond what `audit`'s own public surface already
requires), RFC 7807 problem responses, and audit-of-the-audit-denial via
`candleviewer.audit.access.authorize` (ticket AC "Non-owner cannot read the
audit log" — the denial is itself audited, before the 403 is returned).

Principal resolution: `auth`'s session/RBAC-context middleware is out of
this ticket's scope (E09-T02 does not own it; `auth/service.py` is still
the M18 scaffold with no session verification). Per `x-rbac: {scope: none}`
these routes fail closed rather than guess: a caller is resolved via an
injected `PrincipalResolver` (structurally typed, mirrors `AuditServiceLike`
in `api/auth.py`); the composition root wires a real one when M18 lands
session verification. Until then `create_app()` passes `None` for
`principal_resolver`, and every request is refused with `501 Not
Implemented` (never silently allowed) — no session-verification module
exists yet to say yes or no. Once a resolver *is* wired (PR #1608 review
finding 1: `app.py` now passes one) but it reports "no verified session"
for a given request, that is a normal 401 per the resolver's own contract
(finding 4) — `501` is reserved for the "nothing is wired at all" case.
