"""Global deny-by-default wiring (E09-T03, QA #1648 defect 3).

- Build time: `assert_app_routes_declared(app, spec)` fails `create_app()`
  when a served route is neither RBAC-declared nor explicitly public in the
  OpenAPI contract (and not an allow-listed operational route).
- Runtime: `deny_undeclared_dependency` is a global FastAPI dependency; a
  request to a route absent from the declared set is refused with 403.
