"""api module (M23) — HTTP routers.

Contract-first routers, WS topics, serialisation, authz enforcement.

Public interface only — internal implementation modules are not re-exported.
Allowed dependencies (CONSTITUTION.md C-3.1): all modules' public interfaces.

This module is a conforming EMPTY module scaffolded by E02-T05
(docs/plan/backlog/all-tickets.json), except for the `/healthz`, `/readyz`
and build-info routes which E02-T05 implements per its acceptance criteria.
Real business routers land in the epics that own each resource (see
docs/plan/22-api-openapi.yaml and docs/plan/20-architecture.md Sec.3).
