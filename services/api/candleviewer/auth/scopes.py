"""RBAC policy decision point (M18, E09-T03).

`decide()` answers "may this principal do this thing to this object?",
pure and synchronous over a per-request `PrincipalSnapshot` (roles,
permissions, account scope, loaded once — `docs/plan/20-architecture.md`
P8, §3.10). No ambient context: object-scoped decisions (account id) take
the object as an explicit argument, so the function is trivially testable
and the OMS validator's later use (E39+) stays honest.

Deny-by-default: `decide()` never raises `AllowUnknownPermission` — an
unresolvable principal, an unknown permission code, or a missing account
grant all yield `Deny`. Denials never leak whether the object exists (a
manager asking about another manager's account gets the same `Deny` as for
a non-existent one) — callers must render every `Deny` as a uniform 403,
never branching on `reason` for user-facing text beyond the fixed
`forbidden` body (ticket "403 semantics").
