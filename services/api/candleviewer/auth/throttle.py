"""Per-IP login throttle (E09-S01 "Technical notes": "Rate limiting uses a
token bucket keyed on both user_id and source address").

The per-user side of throttling is `users.failed_login_count`/`locked_until`
(persisted, survives a restart — see `LoginService`); this module is the
*independent* per-IP counter so "one attacker cannot lock every account"
(ticket "Scope / Deliverables"). In-process only (single-process deployment,
`20-architecture.md` C4) — a restart clears it, which is acceptable because
the per-account lockout persists across restarts regardless.
