"""Session-revocation -> WebSocket `4401` close (23-ws-protocol.md §9.5, US-ONB-009).

Transport-agnostic: the (E17) gateway registers one `Closer` per live socket
keyed by session id; the session router's `publish_revocation` calls
`RevocationHub.revoke`, which sends the `bye` frame and closes with 4401.
Latency is observed on `auth_revocation_latency_seconds` (alert > 5 s).
