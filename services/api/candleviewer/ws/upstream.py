"""Upstream reference counting across every WS connection (E17-S02; US-MKT-005).

One upstream subscription per `(symbol, family, params)` no matter how many connections or panes
want it. When the last consumer leaves, the key enters a 30 s grace period and is dropped only
if nobody re-acquires it before the deadline, so a pane close + reopen never churns the exchange
connection. Time is injected (`now` in seconds on a monotonic clock); `sweep(now)` performs the
deferred drops, so tests drive time instead of sleeping. `run()` is the supervised sweeper.

Bounded (C-2.18): one entry per distinct upstream key; keys are only created for topics that
passed the registry parser and the per-connection caps (200 subs x 8 connections per user).
