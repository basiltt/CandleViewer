"""Shared domain primitives (`docs/plan/24-internal-schemas.md` §1).

This package holds the cross-module vocabulary — time/price/qty aliases,
identifiers, symbol/environment literals and the base event envelope — that
every other module imports rather than redefining. It carries no exchange
vocabulary (C-2.2): no exchange-native return-code field, no exchange-native
camelCase field names.

`E08-T01` introduces this package to host the shared types referenced by
`docs/plan/24-internal-schemas.md` §14.1 (`exchange/base.py`) without
duplicating them in the adapter package itself. `candleviewer.domain` has no
module-boundary entry of its own in `CONSTITUTION.md` §3 because it is pure
typing with zero runtime dependencies — every module may import it (see the
architecture note in `primitives.py`).
"""

# The docstring above describes the P3 invariant in prose without naming any
# exchange-specific identifiers as fields, so no allow-list entry is needed
# here. Linked ticket: E08-X03.
