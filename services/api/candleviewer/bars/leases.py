"""Spec leases: reference counting, the 30 s release grace and the hard spec caps (E12-T03).

A *lease* is one consumer's claim on one `(symbol, spec_hash)` series. The series lives while it
has at least one lease; when the last one is released it enters a grace period (US-MKT-005,
30 s) and is torn down only if nobody re-acquires it before the deadline.

Caps (SR-E12-04 / BR-30; E12 STRIDE model): a *new* distinct series is refused with
`SpecCapExceeded` when it would exceed `per_symbol` series on its symbol, `global_` series in the
process, or `per_user` distinct series held by the requesting user. Series in grace still count
(they still cost CPU and memory). Joining an existing series never counts against the symbol or
global cap; it does count against the user's own cap. `user=None` marks system consumers (the
recorder, rules) and is exempt from the per-user cap only. Existing series are never touched by
a refused registration.
