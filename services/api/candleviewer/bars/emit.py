"""The single bar emit path (E12-T03): every `BarUpdate` a builder produces, live or replayed,
goes through `EmitRouter.emit`, which hands the same emission, in the same order, to every sink.

Sinks are injected by the composition root, so `bars` gains no import edge: the QuestDB write
path is `WriterSink` around E12-T02's `BarWriter` (structurally typed), and the WS publisher
(E12-T06, not built yet) plugs in as another `BarSink`.

Backpressure policy (20 §4.2, `Bars lane → sinks`): `emit` awaits each sink in turn, bounded by
`timeout_s` per sink. A slow sink slows the symbol's fan-out loop and, through its `NEVER_DROP`
bus queue, the trade publisher, but for at most `timeout_s` per emission. After that the
emission is skipped for that sink, counted and reported as degraded health. Trades are never
dropped. A bar row the writer misses is healed by its next amend or by a rebuild (ADR-0033).
A sink that raises is counted (`bar_emit_sink_errors_total{reason=<sink>}`) and logged; the
other sinks still get the emission, and
`CancelledError` is never swallowed.

`generation` is stamped on every emission: 0 for the live series. That matches the
`(bar_param, generation, index)` identity proposed in #2019 and the ADR-0033 rebuild hook. A
rebuild would emit under a higher generation through this same path.
