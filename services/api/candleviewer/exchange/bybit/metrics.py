"""Prometheus metrics for the `exchange.bybit` REST client (E08-T02).

Names, labels and help text are **declared** in the ingestion metric
registry (`candleviewer/ingestion/metrics.py` `SPECS`, E08-T06); this module
only instantiates them because `exchange.bybit` may not import `ingestion`
(`.importlinter` M4). `tests/unit/ingestion/test_metric_registry.py` fails if
anything here drifts from its declaration.

`bybit_rate_limit_remaining` is labelled by `scope` (`public|account`), never
by UID: a UID is an account identifier and must not reach a label (E08-T06
security note). `exchange_errors_total` stays owned by `exchange/base/boundary.py`.
