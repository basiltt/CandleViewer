"""Server-side RBAC for the `/admin/audit*` operations (C-12.4).

Grants follow `docs/plan/04-security-program.md` §7.2.1 / §7.2.2 rows 49,
49a, 50 and SR-067 (mirrored in `22-api-openapi.yaml` `x-rbac`):

* `query` (`audit:read`): Owner sees every entry raw; a Manager holding
  `audit:read` sees only entries it is the actor of, with payload, IP and
  user-agent removed (`AuditView.OWN_REDACTED`); a Viewer holds no
  `audit:read` and is refused.
* `verify` (`audit:read`, row 49a): Owner only.
* `export` (`audit:export`, row 50): Owner only (step-up enforced upstream).

Owner-ness arrives on the principal (`is_owner`), resolved by the caller via
`candleviewer.auth.scopes.PrincipalSnapshot.is_owner`; the wildcard grant
`*` is treated as owner too.

Anything that is not provably the Owner is narrowed, never widened: a
principal with `audit:read` but no `owner` role gets the redacted own-events
view. Every denial is itself audited (`admin.audit_denied`, severity
`warning`, outcome `denied`) *before* `AuditAccessDenied` propagates to the
HTTP edge, which maps it to RFC 7807 `403`.
