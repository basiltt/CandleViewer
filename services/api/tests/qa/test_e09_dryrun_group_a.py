"""Automated dry-run driver for the E09-Q01 black-box plan, Group A subset.

QA bug #1623 (parent #227): `qa/plans/e09-auth-rbac-test-plan.md` §10 shipped
with an **empty** dry-run table and §11 sign-off checkboxes deferred
indefinitely to a staging build that does not exist yet (no `E09-S02..S06`
story ticket has merged; `docker` is unavailable in this environment per the
fixer brief). Leaving §10 permanently empty is itself the defect: the plan
can and must record a *real*, evidence-backed dry run for every case whose
dependency (`E09-S01`, merged in #1599/#1609) already exists in `main`, and
must say so honestly for every case it cannot yet execute — not defer the
whole table.

This module is that dry run for the only story currently mergeable against:
`E09-S01` (`POST /auth/login`, US-ONB-001). It drives the *real* router
(`candleviewer.api.auth.make_auth_router`) exactly as
`tests/unit/api/test_auth_router.py` does (black-box: HTTP in, HTTP out, no
internal helper reached from the test body), and doubles as the executable
evidence cited by `qa/plans/e09-auth-rbac-test-plan-dryrun-20260930.md`.

Cases from Group A that are **not** exercised here (A02, A04-A06, A09-A11)
depend on `POST /auth/mfa/verify` (`E09-S02`, not yet merged) and are
recorded as `blocked-pending-dependency` in the dry-run record, not as a
fabricated pass.

    Unlike the other Group A cases in this module (which double the router's
    own black-box contract test and legitimately inject a canned outcome),
    this case's entire point is that *the real `LoginService`* produces the
    same `InvalidCredentials` for two genuinely different code paths
    (unknown-identifier vs. known-identifier-wrong-password). Injecting the
    same fake exception into two fakes would prove only that the router
    forwards whatever it is given — it would not exercise SR-014 at all. So
    this case wires the router to the real `LoginService` over an in-memory
