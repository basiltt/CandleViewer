"""Every §Bn.7 invariant has a chaos case (E50-Q01, 29 §1.7).

The ledger is generated from `28-statechart-catalogue.md`: each `INV-Bn-*`
row is mapped to one fault family (kill/restart, clock skew via
`SimulatedClock`, inbox overflow, restore mid-invoke) and run against its
committed chart in both §1.7 service spellings. Binding bodies are stubs
until their owning epics land, so each case asserts the runtime half of the
invariant: the machine survives the fault with a sound configuration, no
fault latch, nothing silently dropped, and journal replay exactly once.

Invariants whose chart is not yet committed (B1 `order`, B8
`position_protection`) are collected the moment the chart lands — the
pending list is asserted, so it cannot grow silently.
