# E08-X02 findings register — adversarial input at the exchange boundary

Ticket: E08-X02 (#290). Threat source: E08-X01 STRIDE (W1, W9, W10, O9) and
`docs/plan/04-security-program.md` SR-038, SR-040, SR-040a, SR-040b.
Severities: `04-security-program.md` §10.1 (P1..P4) plus the ticket rule **wrong data
with no visible signal = P0**.

**How it was run.** In-process, with no network. Hostile bytes go into the production
entry points the socket pump calls (`TradeStream` / `TickerStream` /
`BookStream.handle_frame`, `IngestionService.offer_frame` / `_pump_frames`,
`BybitRestClient` over `httpx.MockTransport`, the `parse_*` adapters). Time comes from a
fake clock and memory is measured with `tracemalloc`.

**Deviation.** The ticket asks for this to go through the E08-Q03 fault-injecting proxy.
That proxy (#280) is not built yet, so nothing here reimplements it. The hook for it is
`corpus.iter_hostile_frames()`: when E08-Q03 lands, the proxy replays that iterator over
its socket.

**Corpus split.** Hostile payloads are built in code, either in `corpus.py` or by
mutating a recorded E08-T05 frame. They never live in `packages/fixtures`. Minimised
crashers are in `regressions/`, with `INDEX.json` mapping each one to its issue.

Verdicts: **PASS** (the control holds), **DEFECT #n** (filed; test is
`xfail(strict=True)` so a fix flips it), **ACCEPTED** (behaviour is by design; the
rationale is given), **MANUAL** (not automatable here; the cadence is given).

| #1889 | P1  | Deep-nested frame (`RecursionError`) or `ts: Infinity` (`OverflowError`) escapes `handle_frame`, which kills the frame pump for every stream. |
| #1890 | P0  | Off-tick book prices are truncated into the same `price_ticks`, so a level is silently lost or mispriced.                                     |
| #1891 | P2  | `BybitRestClient` signs and sends to any absolute URL given as `path` (bypasses SR-040a).                                                     |
| #1892 | P0  | No plausibility checks: negative or crossed ticker, far-future trade `T`, `1e308` price and kline `high<low` are all accepted.                |
| #1893 | P2  | Frame pump never yields under a backlog (event-loop starvation); `1e4200` prices cost about 1.2 s of CPU per frame.                           |
| #1894 | P3  | No `ingest_rejected_total{reason}` counter; ticker and book rejections are uncounted and have no fingerprint.                                 |
| #1895 | P3  | `BybitSigner.__repr__` prints the full API key.                                                                                               |
| #1896 | P2  | A malformed `instruments-info` row (`AttributeError` / `TypeError` / `OverflowError`) aborts the whole catalogue refresh.                     |

## E — Credential and leakage probes (`test_leakage.py`)

The scan is the repo pattern set (`tools/fixtures/redact.find_leaks`, which mirrors
`scripts/check_secrets_hygiene.py`) plus the three `.gitleaks.toml` bybit rules and the
literal synthetic key, secret and UID. It runs over captured structlog/stdlib output,
the Prometheus exposition, `str`/`repr` of the exception and its cause, and the problem
body.

## H — Fuzzing (`test_fuzz_parsers.py`)

Strategies are structure-aware Hypothesis generators for each parser: trade, ticker and
book frames, raw text, recent-trade pages and instrument rows. The PR lane runs 150
examples per parser. The nightly long session is `CV_FUZZ_LONG=1 pytest -m fuzz` at
20 000 examples per parser; locally it took about 7.5 min. The contract is that a parser
returns or raises `ValueError` / `InstrumentParseError`.

## Not covered here (by scope)

- The sustained-rejection alert rule cannot be validated until #1894 adds the counter.
  It is tracked on #1894.
- The p95 ≤ 20 ms rejection-flood latency slice is blocked by #1893 (D-06 / D-07). Once
  that is fixed, the `perf` case becomes the budget gate.
- TLS behaviour is asserted by configuration only (`wss://` / `https://`, allowlist).
  There is no MITM against Bybit (out of scope).
