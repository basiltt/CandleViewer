# E03 CI gate black-box test plan

Ticket: E03-Q01 (issue #208). Owner: QA. Status: **Draft — pending dry-run execution and second
QA/SDET peer review** (Definition of Done item 1).

This plan is the black-box verification that every required check named in `CONSTITUTION.md` C-9.1
actually fails on the input it claims to catch, and passes cleanly on a no-op change — because a gate
that fails everything is as useless as one that fails nothing. It has no knowledge of the pipeline's
internals beyond the public error-code contract each job publishes (`docs/ci-runbook.md` §2, §4) and the
tool source under `tools/ci/` and `scripts/`.

## 0. How to use this plan

- **Audience:** a QA/SDET with a clone of the repo and no author context.
- **Row scope:** one row per required check name from `CONSTITUTION.md` C-9.1 (columns "Check name" /
  "#"), reproduced here **by reference only** (name + gate number) — the gate *definition* is never
  restated (C-16.5); see `docs/ci-runbook.md` §2 for the job map.
- **Case id scheme:** `E03-GT-<NN>`, one positive + one negative id per row where both are proven
  end-to-end (unit level, in-process); some rows are proven by an existing scripted unit test already
  shipped by the owning task ticket (E03-T05/T06/T07/T09/T13) — those are marked `existing` in the
  Automation column and re-run, not re-implemented, to avoid duplicating another ticket's coverage.
- **Fixtures:** `tests/ci-gates/fixtures/*` (scripted, not long-lived branches — `make ci-gate-fixture
  <name>` regenerates a fixture's inputs on demand so cases stay valid as the codebase evolves).
- **Runner:** `python tests/ci-gates/run_fixtures.py [--case <id>]` drives every fixture against the
  real gate script it targets and asserts the *expected* PASS/FAIL, printing "expected FAIL, observed
  FAIL" (or the mismatch) so a reader never misreads a red run as a problem (Technical notes).
- **Synthetic-only rule (SR-145):** the planted-secret fixture uses an obviously fake, dummy-prefixed
  string (`CV_TEST_DUMMY_SECRET_...`) asserted by its own test to never match a real key shape. No case
  in this plan ever uses or requires a real credential.

Rows without a fixture id in the Automation column and marked "manual dry-run" are proven by directly
invoking the underlying, already-shipped CI tool (Ruff/ESLint/mypy/pytest/import-linter/pr-metadata
resolver) against a one-line deliberately broken scratch file inside the QA session, observing the
non-zero exit, then discarding the scratch file — no fixture directory is needed because the tool
itself *is* the fixture target and already has its own unit tests upstream; re-implementing a second
harness around a generic linter would duplicate, not add, coverage.

## 2. New fixtures this ticket adds

`CI-PROT-002` (renamed required check silently dropped from branch protection) had **no existing
proof** anywhere in the repo — `scripts/check_required_check_reconciliation.py` implements the
reconciliation logic (job names vs. `CONSTITUTION.md` §9 vs. `branch-protection.json`) but ships with
no test asserting the drift path actually raises. `tests/ci-gates/fixtures/protection/` closes that gap:
a scratch `branch-protection.json` + scratch `.github/workflows/*.yml` where `coverage-thresholds` is
renamed to `coverage-check`, asserting the reconciliation script's exit code is non-zero and its output
names the missing job — matching AC Scenario 4 verbatim.

`a11y` (row 9) and `secrets` (row 9/12) had partial coverage (the underlying tools are real and used in
CI) but no scripted, offline negative fixture proving the *gate's own* threshold behaviour without a
live browser/QuestDB stack; both are added as small, deterministic Python fixtures under
`tests/ci-gates/fixtures/` driven by `run_fixtures.py`.

## 3. Positive control

`E03-GT-00`: a one-line comment-only diff to this file's own header touches no code path. Expected: every
applicable check above passes; none fail. This is the "gates are not indiscriminately red" proof
required by the ticket's second Gherkin scenario. Recorded in `tests/ci-gates/records/`.
