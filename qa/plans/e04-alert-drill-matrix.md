# E04-Q01 — Alert drill matrix (R0 subset)

Status: **prepared, pending staging execution** (not run locally: no docker/Prometheus/Alertmanager on the authoring host).
Each row is filled in by QA during the staging drill: UTC timestamps, delivered Y/N, runbook executable Y/N.
Synthetic injection proves the rule; the **real** drills (PostgresDown by stopping Postgres, PublicWsDown by dropping the public WS) prove the metric reacts.
Near-miss = threshold minus epsilon and duration minus epsilon; both must NOT fire (promtool coverage in `infra/prometheus/tests/system_alerts.test.yml`).
Drill windows are recorded in `system_events`; coordinate security-rule drills (AuthLoginFailureSpike, AuditChainVerificationFailed) with Security.

## Execution status and exception request (2026-10-02)

- **Executed locally (evidence):** `services/api/tests/qa/test_e04_q01_blackbox.py` — 12 passed (uv, py3.12, 2026-10-02). Covers in-process metrics exposure, canary-secret redaction across logging paths (AC5), and Prometheus-unavailable fallback behaviour (AC6) at unit/ASGI level.
- **Not executable on the authoring host:** AC2 live drills (fired/received/runbook walked), AC3 near-miss via promtool, AC4 dashboards, and k6 runs (`metrics_scrape.k6.js` p95<50 ms, alert delivery <=60 s). They need docker, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana and k6, none installed here.
- **Owner exception requested:** these staging-only items are deferred to the first staging drill; this PR delivers the plan, matrix, scripts and in-process tests only. QA fills the matrix above and attaches k6 output to E04-Q01 before the ticket moves to Done. Until then the 60 s delivery and <50 ms scrape budgets are **unverified**, not passed.
