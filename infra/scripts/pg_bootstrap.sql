-- infra/scripts/pg_bootstrap.sql — E07-T02
--
-- Idempotent cluster/role bootstrap for the Postgres relational tier
-- (`docs/plan/21-database-schema.md` Sec.1.1). Creates the three roles the
-- rest of the schema assumes exist — `cv_owner` (DDL, runs migrations),
-- `cv_app` (DML only, no DDL — the runtime role every request handler
-- connects as), `cv_ro` (read-only, the only role the DuckDB `postgres`
-- attachment in Sec.5.5 may use) — plus the default-privilege grants that
-- make every *future* table automatically visible to `cv_app`/`cv_ro`
-- without a per-migration grant statement.
--
-- Run as a Postgres superuser (`psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f
-- infra/scripts/pg_bootstrap.sql`), with passwords supplied as `-v`
-- overrides: `-v owner_pw='...' -v app_pw='...' -v ro_pw='...'`
-- (C-12.2/SR-120..124 — never a value committed to this file). The `\if
-- :{?owner_pw}` guards below are pure psql variable-existence checks (no
-- backticks, no shell command substitution), so this parses and runs the
-- same whether invoked interactively or non-interactively via `psql -f`
-- (bug #1556 CI failure: backtick `\set var `echo ...`` substitution does
-- not reliably reach the server the same way across invocation modes, and
-- unconditionally overwrote any `-v`-supplied value). This script **fails
-- closed** (C-12.2): if a caller omits an override, there is no weak
-- fallback password — the block below forces a SQL error, which aborts the
-- run under the required `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1` invocation instead of silently
-- creating `cv_owner`/`cv_app`/`cv_ro` with a guessable password. Production
-- values are injected by the deploy pipeline's secret store as `-v`
-- overrides; local/dev callers must pass their own `-v owner_pw=...` (see
-- `infra/compose/.env.example` for the dev-only values to use, never
-- committed here).
--
-- Safe to re-run: every statement below is guarded so a second invocation
-- against an already-bootstrapped cluster is a no-op, not an error.

-- NOTE: role creation is expressed as three `SELECT ... \gexec` statements
-- rather than a single `DO $$ ... $$` block. psql's `:'var'` interpolation
-- is a client-side lexer pass that does not descend into dollar-quoted
-- string bodies, so `PASSWORD :'owner_pw'` inside `DO $$ ... $$` is sent to
-- the server byte-for-byte (including the literal colon), which the server
-- then rejects with `syntax error at or near ":"` (bug #1556 CI failure).
-- `\gexec` statements are plain top-level SQL, not dollar-quoted, so the
-- substitution happens as intended before the generated `CREATE ROLE` text
-- is sent back to the server for execution.

-- later revision remembering to repeat it. `0012_governance` still owns the
-- authoritative REVOKE for `audit_log` (`docs/plan/21-database-schema.md`
-- Sec.1.1) — this is a defence-in-depth backstop, not a substitute.
